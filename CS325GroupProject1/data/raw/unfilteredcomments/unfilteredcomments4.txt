 He has some sort of binding vow with Sukuna that preparations were made for before he fought Gojo. I would say it’s likely he has some sort of contingency. For starters he is a brain and that’s still alive right now. And we don’t know the mechanism of his CT, but say he physically has to put his brain into a new body - it would mean he can survive and have some mobility while he’s a brain.
</p>

<p>
 The fact that we quickly swapped back to Sukuna and we are told Yuta will jump Sukuna asap, I would say Kenjaku is up to something and it will be revealed at some point later on during this fight with Sukuna.

 Maybe Sukuna will be the one the inherit his "will" and that was their binding vow, Kenjaku turned himself into a cursed object and Sukuna ate it(not with the objective to take Sukuna's body but in case Kenjaku dies Sukuna would be able to use the merger).

 He has to imo, you don't live to over 1000 being that much of a crafty prick without having contingencies on top of your contingencies. At the very least he will have a plan to ensures his scheme goes ahead without him

<p>
 In a manner of speaking yes
</p>

<p>
 Iirc he set the culling games such that it doesnt depend on him living or not which means his death doesnt stop the merger. In other words, his goal was essentially complete as soon as the games started
</p>

<p>
 Regarding any other back ups, i think the fact that he has cursed spirit manipulation should let him control Tengen to ensure his plan succeeds. Further, Sukuna's last finger is currently missing - he
 <em>
  might
 </em>
 have something involving it still.
</p>

<p>
 Finally, he technically accomplished both his stated goals just not in the way he thought. Kenjaku wanted to experience something new, something he hasnt experienced before and he wanted to complete the merger. The culling games will complete the merger bar something unexpected and his fight against Takaba let him experience something completely new

 This might be a horrible idea. But I think sukuna, in his infinite boredom/thirst for entertainment will carry on his idea. For the simple fact that he might want to see what kind of a challenge this creature might present for him to overcome. And he doesn’t strike me as some one who’s afraid to die. He just wants to die to someone (or something) that is actually stronger than him. This could be that something. The last few chapters could just be him and the creature duking it out.

 Solid. But would be bad writing considering sukuna doesn't get ordered around even if he wants that fight. I believe kenjaku will take someone else's body and complete the work.

 You’re probably right. I would just like to see sukuna say “fuck it I’m bored, let’s see what this plan is all about.” After all even kenjaku doesn’t know what’s really going to happen, it’s just an experiment for him. But then again I’m sure sukuna has his own plans

 Again very solid. Sukuna would probably feel bad if he gets killed by a cursed spirit. He wants a jujutsu sorcerer to kill him not a spirit. Kenjaku is playing with fire literally. I personally believe it's yuta who is going to die

 He literally tells Yuta that his plan will be inherited, unless Kenjaku just wanted to do one last troll before he died, he definitely has a contingency plan

 My theory (under the assumption that Toji was right about the death of a CSM user) is that he will give one final command to all the curses in his inventory, which is to inherit his will (or each of them take a piece of his soul). Once they all get released at them moment of his death, the result would be Kenjaku becoming a hive mind within his Cursed Spirit Army, which includes Tengen. If it works, then that means he still has Tengen under his control, can continue the merger, and becomes much more of a problem for the final battle.

 He has been defeated before by six eyes users. I'm pretty sure they didn't just beat him and then let him leave, so even if he seems dead he has a way to keep going.

 Does yuta even know about him being just the brain? I mean Gojo seems to not have asked anyone about what abilities sukuna showed, so i wouldnt be surprised if he said nothing about kenjaku being just the brain.

 Other question: Can he use CSM as just the Brain? In this case, he could just let out all cursed spirits as distraction. Maybe he has a spare body in an inventory curse? Or he really just takes takaba. It would be dumb to think that a guy, who made a plan over 1000 years, doesnt have a plan b for his body getting destroyed..

 He has to. He survived 1300+ years around jujutsu users in constant war. He had to have a back up plan in case he gets caught in a battle

<p>
 maybe he can still reincarnate into Yuta (if it works things gotta be very bad, like if he manage to keep Cursed Spirit Manipulation, Antigravity, his ability to change the background, RCT, the ability of Yuta to copy techniques and Rika that means he could become stronger than Sukuna) or Takaba.
</p>

<p>
 Another possibility that some peoples over that sub shared is that maybe he can force the merge if he die since he can't complete one of the condition for the merge to happens

 Wanting a chaos out of his control, definitely implies that he could die in the process. He just doesn’t want to die so early in his plan.

 I feel like kenjaku has some method to “watch” even if he dies
</p>

 Bro is gonna bust out that afterlife popcorn

 He died for now, then Tengen proceed with the plan to merge humanity and S̶t̶a̶r̶t̶ t̶h̶e̶ s̶e̶c̶o̶n̶d̶ i̶m̶p̶a̶c̶t̶ create the Kaijuu cursed spirit.
</p>

<p>
 Then P̶a̶l̶p̶a̶t̶i̶n̶e̶ Kenjaku somehow returned and take control of the kaijuu.

 Since he thrives on seeing new experiences, it does indeed make zero sense for his plan to still go off if he's not there to experience it.
</p>

<p>
 He's not there to overturn the world order out of any grand vision - he just wants to see what happens himself.
</p>
