 Then... you eventually learn that Inuarashi and Nekomamushi...

 Honestly Jack was so crazy and irrational when first introduced that I fully bought that he would destroy Zou for no reason. Never gave it much more thought after the Minks said Raizo wasn't there

 Imo a very emotional moment and one of the hypest in the series. Knowing that they could have all died, that they chose not to fight, that NONE of them gave up and stuck together. With the Strawhats you expect it, but this was such a surprise.

 It was the most exciting twist I've seen in an anime, instantly teared with the bravery of the Minks. Check out the discussion thread on the chapter release of this moment, its great. Chapter 816 IIRC.

 I was here. On reddit when that happened. A good idea to understand public reaction would be you can open up manga threads on this subreddit from years ago and read up top comments. What was the consensus leading up to that chapter. What were people predicting which SH will fight against which mink when they learn about Samurai. And then the reveal. 
That chapter was Truely a treat.

 Yea, you got it.
</p>

<p>
 I was there when it happened and it was one of the greatest wholesome moments and a twist that can only be appreciated if you read the arc weekly.
</p>

<p>
 It's similar to how chapter 731 flipped the entire fanbase with Sabo's reveal.

 I was more surprised that neko and dog didn’t say anything when they saw Kinemon or painter samurai. 
Imho the whole plot twist felt too forced and I could tell there’s some big twist coming that’ll get too hyped…

 I did not for a second thought about it. I don't know why, but I said after everything the minks went through denying everything about raizo, I thought "there's no way he's good, AND THERE right???". Wrong......

 I'm on mu third or fourth reread, and I just passed that Zhou.
</p>

<p>
 Two parts that really hit hard for me.
</p>

<p>
 One is the Ussop's reaction. He feels so much of the suffering that minks have been through and he's legit  angry at them for not giving up Raizo, but also in awe of the heroism that they displayed, knowing that for all his accomplishments in Dressrosa, he still has a ways to go before he's truly a hero.
</p>

<p>
 The second is just luffy's face when they say; " we'd never sell out a comrade". It's just a perfect image of pride and happiness that these beastmen understand the world just like him. Love it.

 Definitely. It’s a nice twist too. Instead of just making it out for Jack to be some twisted sadist, it makes the minks to be super honorable and loyal Allies. It immediately gives you a great impression of them as good, trusting people.

 So I have a friend who is watching for the first time and just made it to the doflamingo arc. He was at my house and I was finishing my wano rewatch when I almost spoiled a major reveal at the end of wano and had to stop the episode before he could figure it out. I had forgotten just how deep the storyline ran.

 I don't understand why people say this was a huge revela and shocking and what not... To me this event was a regular one piece sunday and I feel like I missed part the excitement somehow. At the time I was all caught up.

 I'm kinda in the same boat.  A little different though.  I think it's still badass they protected someone like that, but with how the minks looked and thinking of Bepo and Law I figured the minks were in on the alliance somehow.  When people talk about it as a reveal, in retrospect, I think I'm not even realizing what the reveal was.  I thought people meant how Raizo was not dead?  But maybe it's the minks being good guys?

 The reveal that Raizo WAS on Zou and thet the minks knew that
</p>

<p>
 Oda managed to make everyone believe for sure that euther Raizo wasn't there, or that he was but the Minks weren't aware of it.
</p>

<p>
 The idea that they would still deny after all they've been through was unfathomable (but also it was never stated that they were allies)

 OH ok I think I get it.  I don’t know why that didn’t get a strong reaction outa me.  I did feel mad respect for their sacrifice, I remember that much.  Just don’t remember thinking Raizo was not there or they wouldn’t be involved.

 Just don’t remember thinking Raizo was not there or they wouldn’t be involved.
</p>

<p>
 Raizo was never said to be on the island. The conflict about Minks almost losing their home because of Raizo and THEN having a samurai come to ask about it was a thing that everyone and their mothers were talking about during the weekly chapter releases.
</p>

<p>
 People were already loving minks as a group and were expressing how they didn't want Minks and Strawhats to fight because that's how the story was being built up only for the "Raizo-dono is safe" moment to happen.
</p>

<p>
 I am genuinely trying to understand how this goddamn epic moment somehow didn't make an impression. It's like one of those moments that embodies the core theme of friendship and loyalty. It's absolutely significant and a masterpiece of reveal.

 I think I’m forever screwed, like if I go back and reread, I’ll probably still not get the same reaction since I know it’s coming but I’ll probably just have to.
</p>

<p>
 It was so long ago all I can remember is reacting the whole way to how much they suffered to protect him.  How loyal they were was inspiring.  I just don’t remember ever thinking Raizo wasn’t there and dammit I wish I had.

 Look at the reaction. This is 7 years old but captures the weekly reaction. I can tell you that as someone who was on One Piece forums, and Youtube, chapter 816 (which is the Raizo-dono is safe chapter) flipped the entire fanbase and everyone was shocked and loved the shit out of this moment.

 This helped so much thanks!  It's probably the only way I can relive it blind through others.  I think it also jogged my memory specifically, but memory is often unreliable anyway.  The moment they started to chase after the samurai panicking about the minks seeing them I remember thinking, "Unless they've truly been hiding him.  Holy shit wait...  That would be extreme."  And at least digging up that thought reminded me of why it was STILL super emotional, but I didn't get like a shock reaction, more of a slow burn of emotion.  Raizo actually being there must have been just burning in the back of my head as a possibility.
</p>

<p>
 TL;DR since I rambled lol: this helped me get the reaction I missed, AND realized my stupid brain just happened to think, "Man, it'd be nuts if he actually was tho" messed me up from a twist dammit.  Still remembered the emotion being strong.

 Everyone was surprised and it flipped the fanbase.
</p>

<p>
 It is genuinely one of those twists that you had to experience on a weekly basis for it to have an impact.

 From a mile away. There was too much emphasis on "there is no Samurai in Zou" that he had to be there.
</p>

<p>
 It's one of the few plot twists I got right so I'm pretty proud of myself.

 I'm not naive enough to think it was a total shock, I understand for some it was obvious but for a 1st time watcher who didn't read the manga, I definitely did not see it coming

 Oh it was a surprise for me too the first time I watched it.
</p>

<p>
 There aren't many plot twists in One Piece, usually there's a fairly linear formula to the story arcs where the crew arrives at a new island, they have a happy time interacting with locals and exploring the area, then the crew witnesses the dark side of what the other pirates are doing to the locals and gets upset that their new friends are being mistreated, Liffy decides he's going to kick somebody's ass and then hijinks ensue.
</p>

<p>
 Always a surprise when we get a curveball that goes against the usual formula.

 Some people are really rushing through their experience and do not care about the sequence of events that lead to twists and turns.

 Oh I care about the experience believe me but how my brain works is once I get hooked on watching something I just can't bring myself to start anything new so I have to finish what I'm watching which in this case is one piece

 I started in May, finished early October. It was like a second job. I watched up to 1000 at 1x and when I got closer to the end, I started 1.5x speed on the filler stuff. I kinda just wanted my life back by that point.

 Are you even enjoying the series? If not then why are you wasting your own time?
</p>

<p>
 There is no race here, my guy. You aren't going to get some prize for catching up. If you think it's a second job then drop the series. You aren't doing the series or yourself any favors.

 I didn‘t see it coming but I didn‘t get emotional reading it back then and was surpised how many thought it was one of the greatest moments of the series, Raizo‘s role in Wano retroactively made the moment even worse for me like really? All of this for this guy?
