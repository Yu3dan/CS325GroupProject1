 Hats off to Moria for going the distance to seek revenge for his fallen crewmates

 Listen as far as most pirates go and especially doing his job as a Warlord, Moria is a decent enough dude. He is no Saint, but could be far worse.
</p>

<p>
 Not to mention seeking revenge for his crew, he does seem to have a level of care for the few people he does have around him. He went to fuck with Blackbeard after Absalom got captured and there's gotta be some love there to put up with Perona's personality.
</p>

<p>
 And as a Warlord I adamantly think he literally did nothing wrong. He parked his ass right before the New World and took the shadows of so many pirates and did his job of hunting down pirates for the World Government. He didn't try to oppress or rule a kingdom like Crocodile and Dogflamingo. Blatantly help out the Straw Hats like Hancock, Mihawk, and Kuma. Or JOIN them like Jinbe. Dude is lazy but he worked smarter not harder.
</p>

<p>
 Not to mention he actually showed up to Marineford with more or less no fight. When they had to drag Hancock kicking and screaming there or lock Jinbe's ass up for not wanting to.

 I mean, yeah, as a Marine ally…
</p>

<p>
 But the main theme of One Piece is Nakama. Loyalty and respect among friends. Transcending friendship into family.
</p>

<p>
 And Moria desecrated thousands of Nakama for his own goals (and that of the Marines).
</p>

<p>
 He might be the single worst OP character under those terms.

 Reading Moria went to Blackbeard to find Absalom really throw me off for the first time because before i'd thought of him as just someone that only cares about himself, it really puts a whole new perspective on his whole reasoning to make zombies and also why Perona is so devoted to him
</p>

<p>
 I really like his writing now

 There’s definitely a lot of hate from those villagers. But Moria had the opportunity to do so much else, and he focused a lot of time and energy into trying to f*** with Kaido and kill him instead of just running and hiding.

 Moria deserves so much more respect than he gets. He lost his whole crew and while he did give up to a certain extent, he wasn’t completely out of the game. Contrast that to Luffy when he lost ace, if it weren’t for his crew he would probably have lost his will to continue. Imagine if Luffy actually lost his entire crew, we would have gotten the worst timeline Luffy Oda drew

 I never really thought about it, but Luffy had no idea if his crew was alive. Imagine if they all died to Kuma except him. Imagine him showing up to Sabaody and nothing is there lol

 I don't think there's enough Kaido left to make a zombie. Lava seems to be extra lethal in the setting.
</p>

<p>
 But if he were to steal the shadow of the currently severely injured Garp.
</p>

<p>
 Put that in a zombie or take it for himself and he'd be a player again. Worthy of joining criss guild.

 Lava is basically the one thing that’s consistently as lethal as it should be (ignoring that you shouldn’t be able to survive being near it) regardless of your power level. From Kuma to Whitebeard, from Marineford to post-Wano, if Akainu chucks some at your face, half your face is melting off, no questions asked.
</p>

<p>
 The only one I could even start to consider having resilience to lava beyond that of a real-life person is Sanji, and that guy is basically made of asbestos with his heatproofing and Germa exoskeleton.

 Bro Lava is lethal.
</p>

<p>
 It melted off half of Whitebeard's head in one hit. Same for the sturdy cyborg Kuma.
</p>

<p>
 Akainu's Lava fist killed Ace. First on screen murder of a named character.
</p>

<p>
 Kaido is most certainly dead. So is old iron balloon herself Big Mom from a Lava bath.
</p>

<p>
 When we see the first Lava proof character they are the toughest in the verse.

 Big mom can’t die from that. I refused to accept that based on that fact that she could have literally created a homie out of lava or clothes or whatever to help herself. In addition there is a few story lines for her left unfinished compared to Kaido which is done. 🤔

 WB could barely use any type of Defensive Haki at Marineford.

 Logia Users have been portrayed to not instinctively use Haki to defend resulting in them getting touched when not on active guard or in the right mental state.

 We haven't seen a grave or actual confirmation of death on BM or Kaido.

 Waiting for the Moria glow up, his fruit is absolutely broken. He will either end up allied to Luffy as a fleet member or might be a dark horse sh contender.
</p>

<p>
 I know lots of people have moria joining the cross guild, but he has more reasons to join Luffy then the CG. Luffy beat Kaido AND Luffy will have motivation to fight Blackbeard to abenge Absalom whereas Moria has no reason to join CG expecting them to be willing to do the same.

 People always forget Moria had an incredibly strong crew compared to the other Shichibukai since Oars defeated all the General Zombies. The WG disposed of Moria because his strength was in his zombie army which he lost after being driven out of Thriller Bark.

 I mean his plan was to use Luffy's shadow to beat stronger and stronger pirates until  he had an army of monsters. Assuming he got that far he could have put up a  decent fight but he'd be waiting a bit for the strong ones to obey him. He doesn't have to outright beat their ass to take their shadows, just catch them offguard.

 Who said he did it specifically for kaido. Yeah the corpse choices fit what you say, but they also fit that he just wanted strong corpses.

</p>

<p>
 There's no way it's a coincidence he loses to Kaido, then steals corpses of people associated with either Kaido or killing dragons.
