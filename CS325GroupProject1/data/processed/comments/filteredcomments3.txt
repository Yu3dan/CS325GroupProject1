Probably normal pirate treasure

I hope it is. I want the One Piece to be something else, but this one should be just regular treasure.

A huge fucking pile of money. Why would it be anything else?

Actual treasure that has been used to fund the Cross Guild.

[â€“] JoyBoy24 [ S ] 7 points 8 points 9 points 10 hours ago (4 children)
It was already established Cross Guild is being funded by Underworld figures

[â€“] Gorlonsins 3 points 4 points 5 points 8 hours ago (3 children)
Financial backing isn't entirely funding something. 
You think Crocodile and Mihawk haven't milked Buggy to fund his own dumb idea at least partially?
My guess is it's a lot of treasure, and he has most of it hidden.

[â€“] JoyBoy24 [ S ] [score hidden] 3 hours ago (2 children)
Crocodile and Mihawk probably never even mentioned Captain's John's treasure to Buggy, the only character we see Oda have ever talk about it/be in search of it is Buggy....we've never seen anyother character besides him show interest in it.
Plus if Buggy did find Captain John's Treasure treasure I'm pretty sure Oda would've explicitly shown that and Buggy himself wouldn't have been worried about having to pay back the money he owes Crocodile if Captain John's Treasure was a bunch of money Buggy found.
So based on all this it's very very unlikely that Buggy has already found Captain John's Treasure and the Underworld figures mentioned by Brannew are the ones granting money to Cross Guild to put bounties on the heads of marine soldiers.

Super weird to ask a question and then write paragraphs saying "NO."

If your answer contradicts an already established point in the story people are free to call it out, also people are free to challenge your opinions even if they're the ones who originally asked for it....in fact that is what makes engagements so fun

its Greenbull's fruit.
the dude who guided buggy in this chapter is greenbull, the chapter's name (233) is "worlds greatest power"
it is supposed to be a reference for gorosei but gorosei are the five elder moons, they have nothing to do with earth, instead greenbulls fruit is the growth of plants, its earth itself, after the great flood and after noah will help to keep everyone above the sea levels greenbull will help with his fruit to restore the earth with plants and stuff. First time we see him his left eye is covered on this chapter 233 and first time we see him in wano his left eye is also covered. He wasn't in the paramount war because he was still ranking up to admiral level.
Greenbull said he hasn't eaten anything in the last 3 years, this scene is 2 years ago, I don't know

His crew killed him because he wouldn't introduce them to his friends?

It's a treasure chest full of body parts of former friends.  John's crew killed him so he'd stop filling it.

Brannew already stated Underworld figures are funding Cross Guild
