I had to explain the cloud to an executive at my company last Friday. She was genuinely curious how they get the data to just float in the sky and I had to explain that the cloud just means the data is being stored on someone else's computer. She initially was asking about this Western Digital "Cloud" hard drive she bought for her home to keep her data safe in case something happened to her house and I had to explain that what she bought is basically a standalone computer with a hard drive in it that her home computer can connect to for storage, and the "cloud" part of it is just because it doesn't have to be plugged directly into her computer or phone. It isn't magically transferring her photos into the sky for safe keeping.

Well for 1, our servers don't read or write that fast. 2, that 10Gbps is being shared amongst everyone on the switch. 10Gbps switches don't mean that you have 48 ports all capable of 10Gbps. That would be a 480Gbps switch.

They're not going to stop until the government passes a law that compels them to.  I'm not sure why people don't understand this.  Nvidia is a for-profit corporation, they will work inside the confines of the law to maximize profits.  If the law doesn't explicitly prohibit them from creating cut-down versions of these cards that can still be used for AI, they will continue doing that.  It's the responsibility of the government to enact legislation that accomplishes the goals of the administration, not to just suggest them and hope that for-profit corporations are going to forgo profits in the name of making the government happy.

Or IBM providing the infrastructure system to make it possible to identify and extinguish the Jewish population in Europe during WWII.
Black outlined the key role of IBM's technology in The Holocaust genocide committed by the German Nazi regime, by facilitating the regime's generation and tabulation of punch cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management, and concentration camp capacity.
It wasn't like they weren't aware of how it was being used either. If I recall correctly from the book, they leased the machines to the Nazis and IBM had to send technicians in the field to do maintenance, repairs, etc. I doubt none of them noticed what was going on around them when doing this 'fieldwork' for the Nazi regime.
Also, the piece of shit Allen Dulles (first CIA director) and his brother (John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State at the same time his brother Allen was CIA director) helped countless Nazis escape after WWII, despite their positions in the US government. Recently read a book about him, " The Devil's Chessboard " that dives into all his fuckery.
They both worked at a white shoe law firm prior to their government careers, Sullivan and Cromwell (an insanely important and influential behind-the-scenes law firm to this day), and just kept helping all their major, transnational companies and friends from Sullivan and Cromwell when they got into office and had the power of the US government behind them.

The problem is that AI acceleration is pretty much mandatory for Nvidia's market. They don't make their profit selling CPU's, they make money selling GPUs and workstation cards both of which now expect tensor cores as a matter of course. You can't sell a modern GPU without tensor cores as all modern gaming tech relies on them and if you're going to buy a GPU with 2015 levels of advancement you might as well just buy a 2015 GPU.

I means, thatâ€™s objectively wrong. The regulatory agency banned chips over 1000 AU. All people are saying is if they donâ€™t want any chips around that capability, then they need to ban at a much lower range.
Since the regulatory agency unilaterally created this ban, and is now saying the ban is wider than previously thought, it seems that the regulatory power is very much in tactâ€¦ they just have very poor communications skills. Considering some of these vague, unprofessional sounding quotes, that seems like the obvious issue.
So where is the evidence that they want to ban these chips but canâ€™t? It seems like the opposite is true. Your worldview is very much off in this instance.

Actually that is how laws work. There is a maximum speed limit but most countries also state in their laws that drivers must act with care and drive according to weather and traffic conditions aka don't drive too fast.

I can't speak to other state's laws, but here in the state of California, you can get a speeding ticket while driving under the speed limit. It's called the "basic speed law" and you can get ticketed for it if, in the officer's judgement, you were driving "too fast for the given conditions."

There is strong evidence to support that China is not buying chips for the consumer market, but in fact require them for their burgeoning AI industry (as well as other sectors that require massive computing power). The Chinese government doesnâ€™t have a great track record in using new technologies like AI in â€œmorally acceptableâ€� ways. Just look at their facial recognition of Hong Kong protestors.

That's the scary thing, AI is convenient because it allows sociopaths to offload agency and it fully automates the systemic parts of systemic discrimination.

The script kiddie problem.  Low technical bar to malicious intent and so many ways it could spiral into complete meltdown.  I really don't think this is an alarmist take, while trying to think of hypotheticals there were so many possibilities I just gave up.  The flip side of this coin is that it's equally easy to use an AI to perform a very subtle attack, the kind that takes human hackers hours days even years of methodical infiltration and requires adaptive techniques and tactics.  The slow and methodical part of this is where an AI would excel, and of course why limit yourself to only one AI?  There is a lot of hysteria out there but we do in fact have to get a leash on this puppy.





[â€“] Takingfucks 65 points 66 points 67 points 6 hours ago * (17 children)
I just spend an unfortunately long time diving into AI policy/regulations in China recently. Iâ€™ve got to say, from what Iâ€™m seeing at their national (CAC) and international level policy they seem to be taking it really seriously. China in the last 18months, has enacted the tightest AI regulations across the world (some of which do cover public facing services only), a lot of them are similar to the EU AI Act. A lot of their policy is also written to build general infrastructure and globally collaborate, and they have shown up to back that up.
In fact, there has been a huge alignment arise in terms of ethics applied to AI, across the world. Despite significant over representation of western values. Itâ€™s a little wild to see. Does China do shitty things? 100%, but (and I apologize for this but I have been battling with my own bias for weeks on my interpretation) - Is the U.S. not guilty of some of these same things? Like the NSA? That one time Facebook meddled in the election and it came out that everyoneâ€™s data was being used nefariously, among other things. The EU passed the GDPR, we had a hearing or two and a documentary, but the lobbyists otherwise disappeared it.
My point is - I donâ€™t think China is the real problem here. They are light years behind us in AI, at least those that are publicly disclosed. The US pumped out 16 different â€œsignificantâ€� models in 2022 alone, the UK had like 3, France 1, China 1, and India 1 (those number may be a little off except the U.S. and China). They produce an insane amount of publications every year, but we have outspent the entire world for the last decade by 100â€™s of billions of dollars, and it shows.
My opinion? I personally think the rest of the world is terrified of the U.S., and the imbalance regarding current advancements. I think that the dropping of atomic bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the following Cold War and living with the tension of nuclear weapons is/has influenced world leaders in how they treat AI. WHICH IS A GOOD THING. There is an effort to actively shut down references to it as the â€œAI Arms Race.â€� I donâ€™t blame other countries for that either, and with the U.S. history of profit prioritization and supremacy - doesnâ€™t it make sense that they would want to bolster their own abilities? The U.S has done some great things but we have also done some incredibly fucked up things as well, and a lot of them. I think itâ€™s disingenuous to paint one so much darker than the other.

The government isnâ€™t really pissed at nvidia exactly. They set an original limit on interconnect speed maximums as an initial upper bound for allowable tech transfers. Nvidia made chips to avoid that limit. The gov has decided that in addition to the interconnect speed limits that they are just going to limit max compute which makes the 800 cards non-exportable. Commerce is just also giving fair warning not to waste time trying to create a card that is 99% identical but passes the new controls because they missed something as they will just close whatever loophole is found

It's pretty obvious the line was set between two product lines with the lower further below 1000. Nvidia created a new design with the sole purpose of selling to China.
Both Nvidia and the regulators knew what the intent of the sanctions were. The government is now telling them they will strengthen the sanctions if Nvidia doesn't stop what they're doing.

[â€“] VTinstaMom 62 points 63 points 64 points 7 hours ago (18 children)
Exactly this. The government can't make a law specifically targeting one chip, because that would be anti-competitive behavior and could open them up to legal action from the corporations. However if they use a outside metric, even if that metric was based upon existing products, the courts won't find in favor of the corporations, if they go ahead and try suing the government.
Essentially, your spot on. The metric was created to outlaw cards above a certain model number. Buy attempting to get under the limit, Nvidia is simply highlighting the true purpose of the sanctions: to prevent any new technology entering the Chinese market which could be used for AI.

b.1. a â€˜total processing performanceâ€™ of 2400 or more and less than 4800 and a â€˜performance densityâ€™ of 1.6 or more and less than 5.92

[â€“] VTinstaMom 5 points 6 points 7 points 5 hours ago (1 child)
I try to remember that everything from regulation, to neoliberalism, to whatever phrase we are using to describe the new version of the system, the world has always been run for the benefit of the powerful, at the expense of those who cannot resist effectively.
Whether we look at the Comanche, the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Chinese, Mongols, British, Dutch, Venetians, Ottomans, Romans... this trend persists.
Every group that finds itself more organized and more powerful than those around them has historically used whatever means possible to maintain the power imbalance in their favor. Simultaneously, each group has always found a justification, both moral and practical, for everything done in maintenance of the power imbalance.
History in a nutshell:
One guy walks up to another guy, bashes him over the head, and takes all of his things. Later a third guy walks up and says "why did you do that?" and the first guy points at the dead guy and says "he was an asshole."
Currently, it's the USA in the power seat, trying to maintain the imbalance. When the next empire takes over, we will have folks just like you and I pointing at that empire, and pointing out that they're just trying to maintain a power imbalance through grossly unfair means.
And everyone will be both correct, but also powerless to stop the trend.

The problem here is their terms are imperfect and require a degree of ambiguity. They want to place a limit on gpu performance that the 4090 exceeds (among other cards). Nvidia's response is to make a 4090d sku that is simply the 4090 but underclocked. This is not following the spirit of the sanctions because literally all they have to do is overclock the chip (which is literally as easy as moving a slider over) and they have a full 4090. The government would not really care if they legitimately made a worse chip for specifically the chinese market (essentially the 4080 is this already) the thing is they are not making a worse chip they are just clocking it down to dodge the sanctions while providing literally IDENTICAL hardware. This is what most of the people in these comments are missing
I think all the sanctions are dumb to begin with and have already backfired (smic achieved 7nm very quickly and all this is doing is costing western companies enormous tons of money to delay them like 2-3 years) but if they are going to do sanctions they can't let nvidia just make the same chip as the west but cut the clock rates when clock rates are easily changeable in software. If they really want to do this they need to do the bans by transistor count or transistor density that would be much harder to dodge.

$300 million should be enough to make anyone think twice.
They also added new mandatory auditing requirements.

Keep in mind, Nvidia is a publicly traded company.  Drawing the ire of the Us government and the looming specter of regulatory hurtles can have a cooling effect on stock.
Will it outright stop this behavior?  No.  But it can throttle it a bit and give nvidia pause.  Its also a signal to other chip makers.

It's already having an effect. NVDA is down $15.50 this morning already.

AI is a national security risk. They can absolutely limit the export or designs of chips used for AI to non allied or approved countries.

Given NVIDIA's behavior and attitude over the last few years i have little sympathy for the company.

The company is literally shitting money and then wiping their ass with more money. The stock price is rocketing to all time highs. There is no one related to nvidia that needs or wants any sympathy.

Redditors should stick to cat pictures instead of commenting on geopolitical issues they have zero understanding of. Some of you people are dumb as fuck.

I want my cat picture to be ray traced in real time.

Perfectly fine if you arenâ€™t in China.

Someone literally said in the comments section of the article that the US is becoming more socialist because of this. I'm so tired of idiots who don't even understand that the United States is not socialist in the least and restrictions like this are very much in line with the current system.

well this is gonna be awkward since the same people have enabled corporations to buy their own laws for a mere 10s of thousands of dollars are pretending they can tell corporations what to do instead of quietly going back under their rock after Nvidia pays its fine. it's important not to make the fine too big so that it's no issue to continually get paid from it indefinitely instead of actually attempting to fix the problem the fine is supposed to address.

Didn't the government set guidelines for what can be sold to China, what's wrong with nvidia following those government guidelines?

[â€“] patrick66 4 points 5 points 6 points 2 hours ago (0 children)
nothing and no one in USG is angry at them, its just that USG is now setting new guidelines that Nvidia will have to also follow with the adendum that we are going to be super strict about it this time (aka no 800 series work around)

Engineer who designs high-performance computing systems (colloquially called supercomputers) here.
Trying to prevent chip producers from making "AI enabling" chips is a perfect example of a solution from people who know just enough to be dangerous .
It's barely meaningful, and not in the way they think.
GPU chips with large pooled memory and lots of tensor cores are currently best for machine learning applications (aka AI*). These chips are "good" because the currently most popular algorithms (stable diffusion and large language models) require large amounts of fast memory and large amounts of extremely repetitive but very simple math. (E.g. the chip spends almost all its time moving things around memory and doing simple arithmetic and trig operations on that data using vectored operations.)
That can and will change in the furure:

The us government has nobody to blame but itself if they are upset about what NVidia is doing.

"Stop doing Capitalism" -US govt to Nvidia, 2023.

[â€“] okonisfree 50 points 51 points 52 points 5 hours ago (6 children)
Um since when did America have unbridled capitalism? Weapons technology â€” for example rockets and jets â€” is well regulated. So is certain encryption technology. Why shouldnâ€™t AI?
