[â€“] Iowa State â€¢ Washington State JakeFromSkateFarm 513 points 514 points 515 points 7 hours ago (15 children)
It wasnâ€™t rudderless, it was just controlled by the bowls.
For example, the Big10 and Pac10 winners always faced each other in the Rose Bowl, regardless of rankings. And Nebraska always played a Florida school in a Florida bowl game, as was tradition.
Thatâ€™s why the 1997 championship was split with Nebraska and Michigan, because conferences were contractually tied to specific bowls and teams had to go based on where they slotted into their conferenceâ€™s bowl hierarchy.
The polls still controlled the rankings, but they couldnâ€™t directly dictate who played where against whom.

I will say it for the thousandth time in the past 15 years, March Madness is the number two sporting event in America behind the Super Bowl for a reason. Every team remotely deserving gets in, and every single team in division one has a path to the title on the court.
FSU was denied a path to the title on the field supposedly becauseof an injury, despite the fact FSU overcame that injury to beat their rival in one of the most hostile places to play in the country, followed by a 10 win team, both of them by two scores.

They were hoping the problem would solve itself and we would lose to Louisville. That way they could boot us without controversy.

If the committee was going to leave them out regardless of what happened in the ACC championship game, I don't understand why they put them at #4 the week prior.
It would have been so easy to just put them at 5 to make it clear they needed a statement win and some help to get in.
Instead they completely fucked everything up and very likely killed the ACC in doing so.

[â€“] Texas â€¢ Team Chaos cardbross 176 points 177 points 178 points 6 hours ago (23 children)
They were probably also in if Georgia beats Bama, since then the Committee still has an SEC team in and can leave both Texas and Bama out without issue, so they'd have needed to do some shenanigans like put Bama at 4, FSU at 5, Texas at 6 to send that kind of message, and even then all last week would have been about "The Committee doesn't respect head-to-head, why even play the game"

People claiming that this was the â€œmost difficult year for the committee to determine the top 4â€� is so absurd to me. Everything actually fell into place pretty perfectly, there were three undefeated conference champions and two deserving one loss teams. Luckily for the committee, those two teams played each other so itâ€™s pretty easy to determine that Texas deserves the final spot.
The only reason that this year was so much more difficult was because an SEC team was potentially on the outside looking in for the first time. If you switch Alabama with Washington and UW had a H2H loss to Texas, the committee would have no problem putting them at 5.

I had always assumed the intent was to prevent situations like this, where the obvious thing was obvious to an individual but if they left it up to a bunch of unanimous polls those things might get missed. Things like head to head, conference championships, and yes, injuries, etc would not be considered in the aggregate causing a worthy team to get snubbed. That was naive of me I suppose.
How did no one on that room see that FSU would have a claim at the national championship? The fact that a power 5 team could be undefeated and have a legitimate claim at the the end of a season is evidence of a complete and utter failure of the committee.

You might not recall this but the prior shitshow system used the AP poll and the Coaches Poll to select the national championship game. The AP requested that they stop using them because they didnâ€™t like that their reporters/columnists were making news instead of reporting on it. The coaches poll was shit because the coaches never watched other games and delegated the task out to grad assistants. Hence we are left with a slightly better but shitty system. Strangely I donâ€™t think there would have been as much protesting if it was the BCS this year with a Michigan vs Washington game.

[â€“] Penn State â€¢ Land Grant Trophy bankersbox98 29 points 30 points 31 points 7 hours ago (1 child)
Fair point about the AP not wanting the job. Honestly the problem with the system is the size of the pool. Yeah the AP poll has some strange votes, but there are enough voters it all gets balanced out. The committee is small with more chance for biases to rise to the surface.

[â€“] Georgia Tech â€¢ /r/CFB Contributor HennyBogan 40 points 41 points 42 points 6 hours ago (0 children)
Not only is the committee a strange size, its made up of individuals who have a current active role in collegiate athletics. So inherently they have some level of self interest and bias. Even then when a conflict of interest appears and a party is expected to recuse themselves, that does not eliminate the potential bias in the conversation.
For example, as committee chair and AD at NC State, Its probable Boo Carrigan took a back seat to the the FSU discussion. But doesn't Mitch Barnhart (Kentucky AD) and Gene Taylor (Kansas State AD) both financially benefit if a team from their conference makes the playoff? When discussing who should be in Texas, Alabama, or FSU, it would seem likely they would have a little bit of home field bias because it would help their universities personally. So would they have also recused themselves?
What about Warde Manuel, the Michigan AD, As he would be representing the no. 1 seed discussions of the no. 4 seed would have direct implications for his team.
So did 4 member of a 13 committee step out of the room for these discussions? seems unlikely.

The â€œeye testâ€� is so stupid. Eg We beat our shared opponents with UW by 200 more combined points (something like 268-66) and were a significantly better team by the eye test according to Vegas. And then they put us on the same field and guess what? Being an undefeated P5 team means youâ€™re really fucking good.

[â€“] LSU â€¢ Southeast Missouri Drnk_watcher 45 points 46 points 47 points 7 hours ago (4 children)
The "eye test" is usually just morons who like QBs who rocket the ball down field and put up a lot of points. Defense or grinding running games need not apply.
At this day in age at least. Maybe 10-20 years ago it was a different story. As sports executives have realized casual fans and bad pundits value scoring over anything else the rules of every major sport have been slowly tweaked to encourage more offense.

UW was being threatened in this exact same way the last half of the season because they weren't passing the "eye test" even though the defense stepped up massively.

In 2004, though, there were three AQ undefeated teams: USC, Auburn, and Oklahoma. One of them was going to get left out. You could argue which one it should've been until the cows come home, but under the system they had at the time, they had no choice but to leave out one of them.
This year, there are three P5 undefeated teams and a four-team playoff. There should be a spot for all three, but the committee decided that Alabama was too important to leave off and screwed Florida State.
If Texas and Alabama hadn't lost, then I could understand leaving one team out and the case for which one, but this is unconscionable.

Yes, with 12 teams it will get even worse. They will put 4-5 SEC teams in every year. Then, during preseason rankings, they'll talk about how the SEC is so great because they got 4-5 teams in the playoffs last year. So they'll rank them high. Then talk about how great the SEC schedules are because all the teams are ranked so high. Which then will give them justification for putting 4-5 SEC teams in the playoffs. Rinse and repeat.

I'm just so frustrated for FSU specifically by the committee's process. They established that 5 conferences 'matter' for the purposes of the CFP and arbitrarily decided that one doesn't yesterday.
It doesn't matter if we think Bama is better (which we don't know), it doesn't matter if we think the SEC is better than the ACC (ACC 6-4 this year), it doesn't matter if FSU's QB is hurt (see: Cardale Jones). No team this year has looked truly dominant against conference opponents - UW hasn't had a double-digit win since September and some thought they'd be #1. Football is an incredibly hard sport to win consistently, no matter the opponent. 
FSU went undefeated and won their conference which for 120+ years has granted top-end teams a shot at a title. It's a sad day.

The BS aspect of this too is there is an under current of "FSU would not be competitive starting their third string QB in a playoff game."
Which one, who cares they won all their games and they've got a month to practice and scheme around a single team. Just do the right thing and reward the effort and record this is their entire season.
But two, Tate Rodemaker was clearly considered serviceable enough to keep that number 4 ranking and is out with a concussion. Which can last for months but he's most likely better come playoff time.
If they're now going to base it on who'd actually take the field then it should consider who that will more than likely be. Not who took the field Saturday night and "we think it'd be bad if they showed up again even knowing they probably won't." Which is all extra stupid because if Jordan Milroe steps off a curb the wrong way and ruptures his Achilles this afternoon it's not like Alabama retroactively gets left out for Georgia or to put FSU back in.

It looks like Keon Coleman is going to opt out. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised to Verse, Fiske, Wilson and a few others do the same. I love FSU, but I canâ€™t watch a bowl game without our best players and the massacre the media will spin if we lose. Itâ€™s too heartbreaking.

I really wish the playoffs were Michigan, Washington, Texas and FSU or whatever the latest AP poll was; no idea how Alabama got in there. 
I suppose SEC bias strikes again?
FSU deserves to be in with that record.

[â€“] Florida State â€¢ Wake Forest westscottstots 204 points 205 points 206 points 7 hours ago (22 children)
Every other poll has us at 4, which should tell you something. Good luck to you guys, the only team I'm really rooting against is Bama now

[â€“] Florida State â€¢ Auburn ttircdj 142 points 143 points 144 points 7 hours ago (8 children)
Not true. Coaches Poll put us at 3, where we shouldâ€™ve been.

[â€“] Florida State â€¢ Wake Forest westscottstots 55 points 56 points 57 points 7 hours ago (2 children)
True, I should have clarified with top 4, not AT 4

Quality Loss. Alabama had one, FSU didn't. It's just the SEC/ESPN way.

[â€“] Florida â€¢ Concordia (QC) Ruler_of_Zamunda 241 points 242 points 243 points 8 hours ago (5 children)
And honestly - Alabama lost to a team that beat Alabama. Thatâ€™s basically a win

A friendly reminder that the best nonconference win between Bama and UGA combined is a 1 possession win over Georgia Tech. Meanwhile FSU has multiple score wins over both LSU and Florida and they don't count for shit.

Lost a game?  Wow, you must have had a really hard schedule...
Undefeated?  Soft schedule I see...

It's not just that. Because dummies will throw liberty out there as justification for Bama getting in. FSU beat a top #15 team and dropped a rank. Texas beat a worse team and jumped 4 ranks. Bama with a loss jumps 4 ranks. It's criminal, it's rigged

I went to bed last night thinking about Herbstreit and the absolute arrogance of them deciding who could win or be competitive at the expense of these kids who have actually gone out and done the work. CFB is beautiful because itâ€™s unpredictable. Nobody can say w certainty that FSU wouldnâ€™t have won any against anybody. But we can now say w certainty they have had their spirits crushed and told their work was for naught. Itâ€™s like losing a game without actually losing. If you werenâ€™t a cynic before I donâ€™t know how you arenâ€™t now.

Weâ€™ve been having this argument for the entirety of the BCS and 4 team playoff era. Should Miami have faced Oklahoma instead of an FSU team who lost to Miami? Should Oregon face Miami instead of Nebraska? Which one loss team USC, Oklahoma, or LSU gets left out? Which undefeated team USC, Oklahoma, or Auburn gets left out? Should Michigan get to rematch Ohio State, instead of Florida going? Should undefeated Boise State be left out? Should Texas have faced Florida instead of an Oklahoma team who lost to Texas? Which one loss conference champion Oregon, Alabama, Ohio State, or Baylor should be left out? etc etc.
Itâ€™s funny that in the first season and the last season of the 4 team playoff, thereâ€™s at least 5 teams who could arguably be the best team in the country. This season would be perfect for an 8 team playoff. Maybe one or two teams who donâ€™t belong there get in, but thatâ€™s better than this.

Bama has a quality loss and FSU does not, easy decision.

Bama fans acting like pompous pieces of shit since this announcement. Since they get what they want, the back bending to justify with speculation about how FSU would get destroyed is absurd.

[â€“] Florida State â€¢ Tulsa Here4TheEveryclear 185 points 186 points 187 points 7 hours ago (46 children)
All they had to do was be happy they made it and shut up but instead they have to beat down on the team that got screwed. Itâ€™s really hard to act like itâ€™s a few bad apples when every post has at least 5 Bama fans absolutely ripping into FSU.

[â€“] Auburn wdeallan 124 points 125 points 126 points 7 hours ago (17 children)
They wonâ€™t admit it. They will say every ESPN talking point about why they are in, but they wonâ€™t admit the real reason.



[â€“] Florida State â€¢ Harvard jinglejoints 75 points 76 points 77 points 6 hours ago (6 children)
Commenting the same â€œbe honest do you REALLY think FSU wouldnâ€™t just get blown out??â€� lines as well.
Like, no bitch I actually think we have a shot but we will never know. Put an asterisk on your record now.

[â€“] Washington â€¢ Auburn ChaiMeALatte 24 points 25 points 26 points 5 hours ago (2 children)
People have been saying this to the Huskies all season and it reached a fever pitch before Friday nightâ€™s game. How many dumbasses were running around saying that they had no chance against Oregon, Oregon was going to annihilate them in the CCG, theyâ€™ve looked bad against bad teams while Oregon has looked consistently dominant, etc. etc. Thereâ€™s a fucking reason you play the games instead of just looking at stats to decide who wins.
This was such a bad decision by the committee for the integrity of the sport and you all got royally fucked. My team is in and I canâ€™t even really enjoy it. That for sure would have been us being left out if Oregon wasnâ€™t such a media darling.

â€œThe committee's decision not to include an unbeaten team from a major conference like Florida State in the 2023 playoffs sets a new precedent in college football.â€�
I like how they have to acknowledge the conference qualifier, given that my first question for the Times is where were they in 2017. Maybe they complained then, I donâ€™t know, but I suspect not.

I really hope that the fans of G5 schools are lapping all of this shit up, because what happened to FSU this year is what has been happening to the G5 since the shenanigans began.  It's only now that it happened to a school with a pedigree that everyone is up in arms about it.

Undefeated teams being left out and the results on the field not mattering is literally the fundamental difference between CFB and the NFL and has been  since before anyone grandparents were born.

Didnâ€™t FSU have a better strength of record too? Isnâ€™t that MORE reflective of how a team has felt with their record??

[â€“] Michigan â€¢ Penn State moysauce3 103 points 104 points 105 points 7 hours ago (17 children)
Or Auburnâ€¦ dropping 9 and still allowing a game winning TD.

I think itâ€™s Georgiaâ€™s fault for not winning Saturday more than either of those

Let me apologize for Georgia not beating Bama in the SEC championship and avoiding this whole s-show.
I wore the wrong lucky shirt on Friday and the right lucky shirt on Saturday wasn't enough to make up for it. Totally my bad.
