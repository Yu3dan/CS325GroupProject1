He has some sort of binding vow with Sukuna that preparations were made for before he fought Gojo. I would say itâ€™s likely he has some sort of contingency. For starters he is a brain and thatâ€™s still alive right now. And we donâ€™t know the mechanism of his CT, but say he physically has to put his brain into a new body - it would mean he can survive and have some mobility while heâ€™s a brain.
The fact that we quickly swapped back to Sukuna and we are told Yuta will jump Sukuna asap, I would say Kenjaku is up to something and it will be revealed at some point later on during this fight with Sukuna.

Maybe Sukuna will be the one the inherit his "will" and that was their binding vow, Kenjaku turned himself into a cursed object and Sukuna ate it(not with the objective to take Sukuna's body but in case Kenjaku dies Sukuna would be able to use the merger).

He has to imo, you don't live to over 1000 being that much of a crafty prick without having contingencies on top of your contingencies. At the very least he will have a plan to ensures his scheme goes ahead without him

[â€“] 5meothrowaway 8 points 9 points 10 points 2 days ago (1 child)
Of course he does heâ€™s been around for 1000+ years, not having a plan would be braindead

In a manner of speaking yes
Iirc he set the culling games such that it doesnt depend on him living or not which means his death doesnt stop the merger. In other words, his goal was essentially complete as soon as the games started
Regarding any other back ups, i think the fact that he has cursed spirit manipulation should let him control Tengen to ensure his plan succeeds. Further, Sukuna's last finger is currently missing - he might have something involving it still.
Finally, he technically accomplished both his stated goals just not in the way he thought. Kenjaku wanted to experience something new, something he hasnt experienced before and he wanted to complete the merger. The culling games will complete the merger bar something unexpected and his fight against Takaba let him experience something completely new

This might be a horrible idea. But I think sukuna, in his infinite boredom/thirst for entertainment will carry on his idea. For the simple fact that he might want to see what kind of a challenge this creature might present for him to overcome. And he doesnâ€™t strike me as some one whoâ€™s afraid to die. He just wants to die to someone (or something) that is actually stronger than him. This could be that something. The last few chapters could just be him and the creature duking it out.

[â€“] Independent_Leek1751 -1 points 0 points 1 point 1 day ago (2 children)
Solid. But would be bad writing considering sukuna doesn't get ordered around even if he wants that fight. I believe kenjaku will take someone else's body and complete the work.

[â€“] SolidOk5838 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 day ago (1 child)
Youâ€™re probably right. I would just like to see sukuna say â€œfuck it Iâ€™m bored, letâ€™s see what this plan is all about.â€� After all even kenjaku doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s really going to happen, itâ€™s just an experiment for him. But then again Iâ€™m sure sukuna has his own plans

[â€“] Independent_Leek1751 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Again very solid. Sukuna would probably feel bad if he gets killed by a cursed spirit. He wants a jujutsu sorcerer to kill him not a spirit. Kenjaku is playing with fire literally. I personally believe it's yuta who is going to die

[â€“] Ashamed_Anywhere_930 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 day ago (0 children)
its kenjaku bruh, of course he thought "what if gojo caught me lacking?".

[â€“] Legitimate_Cow7198 3 points 4 points 5 points 2 days ago (0 children)
He literally tells Yuta that his plan will be inherited, unless Kenjaku just wanted to do one last troll before he died, he definitely has a contingency plan

[â€“] worldsdankestmeme 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 day ago (0 children)
My theory (under the assumption that Toji was right about the death of a CSM user) is that he will give one final command to all the curses in his inventory, which is to inherit his will (or each of them take a piece of his soul). Once they all get released at them moment of his death, the result would be Kenjaku becoming a hive mind within his Cursed Spirit Army, which includes Tengen. If it works, then that means he still has Tengen under his control, can continue the merger, and becomes much more of a problem for the final battle.

[â€“] Public_Database2182 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 day ago (1 child)
I personally think 1,000 curses are going to erupt out of Kenny and even though yuta is a beast, 1 of those 1,000 is gunna grab the head and make a run for it

[â€“] Independent_Leek1751 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Absolutely glorious. Now that's is a peak fiction

[â€“] Kookie2023 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Of course he does. Guy has been alive for 1000 years with ppl constantly willing to kill him. You think he doesnâ€™t have a contingency plan?

[â€“] luceafaruI 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 day ago (0 children)
He has been defeated before by six eyes users. I'm pretty sure they didn't just beat him and then let him leave, so even if he seems dead he has a way to keep going.

[â€“] EinkeksigeEule 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Does yuta even know about him being just the brain? I mean Gojo seems to not have asked anyone about what abilities sukuna showed, so i wouldnt be surprised if he said nothing about kenjaku being just the brain.
Other question: Can he use CSM as just the Brain? In this case, he could just let out all cursed spirits as distraction. Maybe he has a spare body in an inventory curse? Or he really just takes takaba. It would be dumb to think that a guy, who made a plan over 1000 years, doesnt have a plan b for his body getting destroyed..

[â€“] CuzzyPopper 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
He wouldâ€™ve survived if he didnâ€™t reveal his real identity to gojo

[â€“] Hour_Tomatillo_2365 -1 points 0 points 1 point 2 days ago (1 child)
No he had no back up plan.

[â€“] Independent_Leek1751 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
He has to. He survived 1300+ years around jujutsu users in constant war. He had to have a back up plan in case he gets caught in a battle

[â€“] nerussita-8787 -1 points 0 points 1 point 1 day ago (1 child)
maybe he can still reincarnate into Yuta (if it works things gotta be very bad, like if he manage to keep Cursed Spirit Manipulation, Antigravity, his ability to change the background, RCT, the ability of Yuta to copy techniques and Rika that means he could become stronger than Sukuna) or Takaba.
Another possibility that some peoples over that sub shared is that maybe he can force the merge if he die since he can't complete one of the condition for the merge to happens

[â€“] Independent_Leek1751 -1 points 0 points 1 point 1 day ago (0 children)
Yuta for me.

[â€“] carl-the-lama 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (2 children)
I donâ€™t think kenjaku ever planned on living
Dying is likely something that happens at some point in the plan

[â€“] PhreeKarebu 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 day ago (1 child)
Wanting a chaos out of his control, definitely implies that he could die in the process. He just doesnâ€™t want to die so early in his plan.

[â€“] carl-the-lama 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
I feel like kenjaku has some method to â€œwatchâ€� even if he dies
Bro is gonna bust out that afterlife popcorn
Waitâ€¦. If kenjaku dies what happens to tengen?

[â€“] VoidMageZero 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
100% has a backup plan.

[â€“] FireZord25 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
The question isn't if, but what. He spelt it out he has a backup plan that chapter.

[â€“] MIL_1999 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
He died for now, then Tengen proceed with the plan to merge humanity and SÌ¶tÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶tÌ¶ tÌ¶hÌ¶eÌ¶ sÌ¶eÌ¶cÌ¶oÌ¶nÌ¶dÌ¶ iÌ¶mÌ¶pÌ¶aÌ¶cÌ¶tÌ¶ create the Kaijuu cursed spirit.
Then PÌ¶aÌ¶lÌ¶pÌ¶aÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶nÌ¶eÌ¶ Kenjaku somehow returned and take control of the kaijuu.

[â€“] BotherResponsible378 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
I cannot imagine what his last line could possibly mean otherwise. So yes.

[â€“] Wisniaksiadz 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Considering he is ,,the master" of binding vows, he probably have a binding vow that goes like ,,if I Die, then dont" or something simmiliar

[â€“] Snips_Tano 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Since he thrives on seeing new experiences, it does indeed make zero sense for his plan to still go off if he's not there to experience it.
He's not there to overturn the world order out of any grand vision - he just wants to see what happens himself.
