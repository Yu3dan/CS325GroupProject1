Look at mommy's behavior
1. Shows up unnoticed at son's house. Son may have been out or with his gf. It's a one bed flat
2. Walked into his room at his house without knocking. He is 35
Obviously, to her, he's a "little baby" who can't do anything without hus momma. That's ehy she feels entitled to invade his privacy. It's also a control tactic. As long as she can convince herself that her son is a kid, she can justify barging into his life.
Now, if you throw a gf in the mix, as ling as thats only dinner or dates, it's fine. She can pretend that they're just holding hands and singing high school musical songs. 
But when she sees her kissing his son in lingerie, her illusion falls apart. She has to admit to herself that son isn't a baby anymore and she has to recalibrate her relationship with him, essentially accepting that she can't control him anymore.
To her, it's easier to accuse gf of being an evil "night lady" who's robbing her naive, innocent, precious son of his virginity, completely ignoring that he's 35.
Good for son, he stood up for his gf and kicked her out. She needs a reality check. Sadly, she'll just add this to her list of things the "evil gf" did. Brainwashed innocent baby against his OWN MOTHER. GASP!!!

Apparently we were â€œtaking too longâ€� and she â€œjust had a questionâ€� I was really off put like canâ€™t you knock ? I have never walked into a room with a closed door without knocking.
It was 5 minutes max he has a 1 bedroom apartment and I was just telling him why I would not take my jacket off. I got the feeling that she simply didnâ€™t like the fact that he went into the room with me but we are grown ups so the whole interaction with her rubbed me the wrong way.

Absolutely! Even in the most informal family dynamics, there's a basic level of respect that includes acknowledging someone's privacy. Just because you're family doesn't mean you get a pass on common courtesy. She should really learn to text or call ahead, and definitely to knock! Maybe it's time for some boundaries to be set, or this will just become a recurring issue.

She came after you two â€œbecause you were taking too longâ€� means she thought you two were kissing and wanted to barge in and stop it.

If that was my son he would have said "Sucky timing, Mum. Grab a hotel and we'll see you in the morning."
And way ahead of him, I'd already be making tracks for the door, giving his GF a subtle thumbs up on the way out.

NTA. You are both fully grown. She has no business opening the door when she knows a couple went in there (not that you were having sex just that clearly thereâ€™s a private convo going on).  My son is 17 so not quite there ish (well not to ladies in lingerie surprising him at his own house) but to me this would just be hilarious. Like preferably it wouldnâ€™t happen but if it did I would be worried about the girl - that she would be mortified and maybe could never look me in the face again. Iâ€™d profusely apologise, tell you everything was totally fine and to get changed and lets eat. And at your age I would be hoping this was the hilarious way I met my DIL, whose clearly an attentive girlfriend! Iâ€™d be more excited by the fact you had a key to the apartment then I would be shocked that a grown woman is having sex with my son.
He was right to kick her out. She needs better boundaries. All in all you know your bf will stick up for you so thatâ€™s a win really.

The mother is bulldozing conventional social norms and expected boundaries to undermine her sonâ€™s relationship, compete with his new love interest for his attention and try to assert control over a situation sheâ€™s pathetically threatened by.
I would run, not walk, away from this relationship but it seems your bf called her out, sent her off and made his loyalties known- all of which he needed to do in order to preserve this relationship and steer his mom back into her own lane. Good luck, she seems like a piece of work honestly.

Too many people would have ended up being unfair to the girlfriend, by entertaining their insane overbearing parent's criticisms, in a hopeless attempt to keep the peace.
It obviously shouldn't happen, but everyone knows it does, too often.
It looks good for the relationship and his maturity that he kicked his mom out for being stupid and crazy, and defended his GF, who did nothing wrong.



[â€“] Ok_Addition_6716 259 points 260 points 261 points 17 hours ago (7 children)
It sounds like an unfortunate and awkward situation. It is not your fault that the encounter with your boyfriend's mom turned out this way and the surprise visit was unexpected for everyone involved.

[â€“] steinmas 22 points 23 points 24 points 14 hours ago (2 children)
Unexpected sure but there is no reason to call your sons new gf that on their first meeting. Clearly she doesnâ€™t respect boundaries, and is probably super controlling. This is not how rational people behave.

[â€“] CaliTexican210 220 points 221 points 222 points 16 hours ago (24 children)
NTA - Neither of you knew it was a â€œfamily dinner.â€� You are both grown consenting adults. Who the hell comes from â€œout of stateâ€� as a surprise?!?! He is 35 FFS. He was right to kick her out for disrespecting you in his home, but at the same time, could he not have shot you a quick text to tell  you she was there? Seems odd he wouldnâ€™t, but itâ€™s possible you were driving while he did and didnâ€™t see it in time. Sheâ€™s unhinged.
So, heâ€™s shown you he can strong arm her and not cater to her tantrums, but is this something you can deal with for years? Do you see a future with him? Are you OK with her just showing up uninvited? Make sure you and he are on the same side about boundaries.

[â€“] SprinkleGlitter7 [ S ] 393 points 394 points 395 points 15 hours ago (21 children)
So my I kept most of the vulgar insults out of the post, but her calling me a whore was the nicest part of it.
We had a long discussion about that I told him Iâ€™d never be ok with surprise visits its inconsiderate and rude to assume that would ever be ok.
My boyfriend talked to her Saturday over the phone and told her unless she apologizes heâ€™s going no contact. My boyfriend and his mom have had a very tumultuous relationship so this is basically the icing on the cake for him.
Seeing as he did and will have hard boundaries with her helps put me at ease in regard to a future.

[â€“] CaliTexican210 70 points 71 points 72 points 15 hours ago (0 children)
Itâ€™s a shitty situation, but Iâ€™m glad you experienced it early and had the discussion to be on the same page. Honestly, if sheâ€™s a narcissist, any apology will not be genuine. The way she disrespected you should be the nail in the coffin, not the last chance. If she gets therapy, maybe. You donâ€™t get to tell him what to do of course, but until she gets help, going NC may be best. Iâ€™m sure it stung, but it was a reflection of her, not you. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with enjoying sex or being sexy. Donâ€™t let anything she said get to you.

[â€“] AdPresent6703 36 points 37 points 38 points 14 hours ago (0 children)
He also should've texted you when she arrived. Even if you hadn't arrived in lingerie ðŸ«£ðŸ˜‚ that still sucks unexpectedly thrust into meeting his mother the first time!
I'm happy for you he's not a total pushover, though.
As an aside- I first met my husband's mother unexpectedly too. He and I were kissing when she arrived at my graduation. At least I was wearing a cap and gown. She didn't actually verbally call me a distasteful slur for a sex worker, but her face sure did! ðŸ™„ðŸ˜…

[â€“] DodgyRedditor 44 points 45 points 46 points 15 hours ago (0 children)

You have a three post AITAH saga from 111 days ago where you say youâ€™re 27 years old. And one from less than 2 years ago where you claim to be 26.
The saga from 111 days ago is about taking forced custody of your brotherâ€™s daughter after being the primary caregiver for three years, and then trying to go anonymous while moving housing locations, cutting off all your hair and then planning on moving across the country, or at least out of state.
And youâ€™re still with your boyfriend of 6 months?

[â€“] GrouchySteam 14 points 15 points 16 points 15 hours ago (2 children)
NTA- from the title I expected something else and I have to thank you for the laugh, with full compassion.
You were not inappropriate. You were expected to come over with the intention to spend the night, with and at the place of someone you currently date. 
You didnâ€™t exposed yourself on arrival. You didnâ€™t disclosed the motivations behind keeping your coat.
She invited herself over without warning. She imposed herself. She then followed a couple into their bedroom and let herself in without warning. She should have been mortified to walk on you, apologising for mindlessly entering the bedroom as she owned the place or forgot to respect her child privacy as he wasnâ€™t an adult in his own home.
What I found more concerning is the slut shaming and violent reaction about basically her son being sexual.
At least your boyfriend sounds to have reacted quite appropriately.
You handled it in the best possible way, her reaction was unhinged.

[â€“] SprinkleGlitter7 [ S ] 12 points 13 points 14 points 15 hours ago (1 child)

Genuinely sorry you had this experience.
Just to be clear, you being exposed by surprise without consent, isnâ€™t funny at all.
