After the last few chapters Kuma has become much more terrifying than his initial introduction.  If he wasn't a pacifist, between his natural bulk and his DF, the dude could have taken down the world

Yeah the guy is a monster. A cute cuddly teddy bear of a monster but a monster nonetheless.

That is exactly what popped in my mind when i saw the pic. It is incredible to see how Oda is able to alter our views of a single character and how we feel about them.

Got curious and it was about 100-300$ when it was first available, all sold out of course or sketchy as hell sites since these figures always just sold for a limited time
