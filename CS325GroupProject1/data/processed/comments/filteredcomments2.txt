Thatâ€™s why the economy is doing great.
Itâ€™s a credit based economy, and the US people bailed out the banks, and the auto companies, and these fast food corporations arenâ€™t hurting in any way shape or form right now, but ya know neither is Congress, so thatâ€™s alright.

Sorry, what? Many people buying things they can't afford on credit, also known as financial distress, is a common harbinger of a recession.

[â€“] FunnyRabbit4780 36 points 37 points 38 points 12 hours ago (124 children)
Many people think it's far worse than that, for some reason it feels like we are in the end times of a very long peaceful period, our economy was always growing one way or the other, there was hope across the horizon.
Now many feel like the good times are over once and for all, the drive towards a multipolaire world, inflation being this high, extreme political developments.
Theres Taiwan, Israel, Ukraine, then a lack of growing wages, not enough room to rent, food, a basic necessity by all means, is growing super expensive, this all feels like the prelude to an apocalypse.
Personally I've bought a pretty expensive PC because I don't know if Taiwan will be gone in a few years time, and if my country gets attacked I wanna spend the last years doing things I enjoy, if everything goes downhill money will become totally worthless anyway.
And even if I do everything right, inflation won't stop, in 10 years everything will be at least twice as expensive as it is now, meanwhile wages will grow by what, 10-20%? Doesn't make sense to save money for old age, I know that I will have to work until I'm dead.

We're in the same boat, my wife and I make around 200k combined (I work in sales so it fluctuates slightly) we have an affordable mortgage and little overall debt, and yet I'd rather jump off a bridge than pay all the crazy fees for door dash/delivery. I'm always happy to go out to pick the food up, or sometimes one of us will grab food on our way home from work. I can safely say we get food delivered maybe 3-4 times a year, and usually there's a reason such as one of us being home sick.

I work 48 hours a week as a corrections officer at a state jail. My rent is 600 a month, my car payment is 450, health insurance is 450, 350 to other retirees retirement which isnâ€™t a benefit available to me or others that started after a certain date, 180 for electric, 300 every two months for propane, 100 for internet and 100 for phones. My groceries go on credit and they cut off overtime for anyone working at my unit so now Iâ€™m scrambling to get a second job at the county jail because I have a kid on the way. The only way out of this hole is if I die at work so my wife can receive the life insurance payment. The saddest part is itâ€™s one of the better paying jobs in the area.

Utilities are also more than just electricity.
My electricity is balanced over the year so my peak summer months are less but my winter months will be higher. But I usually average close to $200 (Mississippi) for electricity. $70 for internet, $25 for garbage and sewage, $50 for water, $50 for gas. So thatâ€™s $400 for just things I would consider utilities. If you add things like car insurance and cell phone bills thatâ€™s another $350. Bringing the total to $750. And then probably another $60 in entertainment subscriptions. Thatâ€™s over $800 a month, now I wouldnâ€™t consider them all â€œutilitiesâ€� because I could live without some of them but for the most part to be a functioning member in society the above bills are necessary.

[â€“] Chance-Letter-3136 2 points 3 points 4 points 18 hours ago (2 children)
My electricity is my biggest. During non-summer months it is about $150. My waste & water is about $50 a month and my phone is $50, my heating is about $20, and internet because my wife and I work remote is $120(with a $90 reimbursement)
I would disagree on including insurance, gas, and subscriptions in the utilities category, but thanks for explaining how you got your number.

Housing has gotten more expensive since the 90s, that much is true. Living alone as an 18-25yo is more of a luxury than it used to be.
Still, all that means is people (primarily young, single people) need to more often choose between living alone, having a car, going out / using doordash frequently, etc. Could it be improved? Yes. Is it a capitalist hellscape? Goodness no.

Get a roommate or two, leverage the cheaper COL to save money for 6-12 months. find an accelerated trade school program, buy a certification program on course careers, do literally anything to increase your earnings potential. Stop doordashing, learn to cook cheap and healthy, make yourself more attractive through diet, exercise and grooming, because that alone will have an affect on your ability to earn more money. Sacrifice for a year or two so that you can improve your situation.

This may be an unpopular opinion on here but, if youâ€™re making the median income, meaning that just about the same % of people make more than you and make less than you, then you probably shouldnâ€™t HAVE to live in in a dump and or with roommates. That says to me that that economy has failed its participants, especially when the top echelon gets to to own their own islands, enormous boats, private jets and leave their families more money than theyâ€™ll be able to spend in 20 generations, even if they never generate another cent again.
Your callous â€œwell yeah, the majority of people SHOULD just live in squalorâ€� betrays your lack of empathy and how much you underestimate the lower classesâ€™ chances of overthrowing a society just like theyâ€™ve done in almost every empire in human history.
Every society starts by understanding you have to keep the middle and lower class happy enough so they donâ€™t want to break the status quo, but then the top % keeps taking and taking and telling themselves the lower class will never revolt. Keep testing just how miserable you can make the bottom half before they decide to do something about it. Time will tell.

[â€“] CMDR_Ray_Abbot 9 points 10 points 11 points 17 hours ago (13 children)
The real problem is rent in cities, I'd be interested in seeing what that median rent is without NYC prices, and what variables they're using to determine it. Are we including luxury apartments that can go for 100k+ a month? Etc. Every time people talk about that 2000 number I scratch my head a bit because rent around me sits between 400-800 depending on what size of apartment, all the way up to a small house. I also live in Rural Kansas though so... I figure urban rents drag that number up.
(This isn't a "just move, hur hur hur" post. I'm just interested in how the variables work out is all.)

The difference this time is with those billionaires and elitist rulers; they donâ€™t want to control the populations, they want to depopulate the planet - they donâ€™t care if you are happy or not.  Thatâ€™s why the WEF will tell you you will own nothing and be happy, happy to be alive and not dead like the majority will be by 2050.

Or like... you know, a cheaper apartment?
I mean the average rent in the US is 1,300.  Not sure where the guy got the value for 2k for the median, but my guess it's probably the median rent for a specific sqft or specific to an area, not across the US.
Granted his car payment value also seems really high, even at like 20% interest rate on a 20k vehicle it shouldn't be that high, so I question in general where these values are coming from.
Like not saying there aren't issues, but his numbers seem a little absurd

I live in the Boston area, one of the places with the highest rents, and I pay $1910 for a 1 Bed 1 Bath (typically the most expensive layout per person) that is very spacious.  I could find a much smaller apartment for probably $1400.  It would definitely be small, but also 100% livable.  I grew up in Philly though, and my mom rents her entire house (2 floors and a basement, 3bed, 1bath) for around $800 in a decent neighborhood.  I grew up in that house and it was entirely livable.
The notion that if youâ€™re not spending $2000 on rent then youâ€™re not in â€œlivable conditionsâ€� is downright absurd.  The number in this post is extremely misleading as that includes all rentals , not just those with one person.

If youâ€™re poor, you likely miss payments, bad credit score etc. poorer people usually get higher interest rates too due to low down payments and bad credit history. Your take makes no sense. Not everyone qualifies for low interest rates or has the privilege to pay 20 down when buying

[â€“] vorpalbunneh 32 points 33 points 34 points 19 hours ago (4 children)
Once your credit gets bad enough you get NO interest rates, because nobody will loan to you, and then you get to buy at one of those places where you get a barely working car that you have to pay for weekly or every other week and wind up paying way more than it's worth (keeping you that much poorer even longer.)

I found that the $500+ monthly payment is coming from a $20k loan at 20% (which bad credit loans can apparently get up to...) assuming a 5 year loan, which is what I understand to be typical.

Yup, sure is what I'd call a recession.
Edit- To the "what job" folks, I wrote a more detailed description down there somewhere and it got buried, but it's your public utilities. They are high paying union jobs, and it's all on the job training. A Plant helper, meter reader, stockroom positions, etc are all high paying union jobs. And those jobs then get you seniority to bid on even higher paying jobs such as plant operations, lineman, machinists, electritions, etc.

Flights are overbooked because thatâ€™s how the airlines run things currently: less flights, jam people in, hope a few donâ€™t show up, compensate a few people if they get booted due to lack of seats.
Drive through are getting more business because sit down chains are slowly pricing people out and/or shutting down. When the money gets tighter or prices increase more, the drive through lines will explode as the semi-fast food places like Moeâ€™s, Chipotleâ€™s, Five Guys, etc. price out customers.

B) The whole restaurant is being run by (if you're lucky) two people (only at peak hours; on off hours, one), and the line is getting backed up because there's a limit to how fast they can get orders done on a skeleton crew.

His median numbers are off - median household income is $74k as of last year. It's more important to look at household because that's where the rent/mortgage is due.
So he's spinning data to paint a false narrative. Not everyone lives alone. Tons of dual income families that pay more for rent/mortgage because they can afford it which drives up the overall numbers, but he still uses the smaller individual number because he's dishonest.

1) itâ€™s not that bad but people saying itâ€™s bad on social media is making it seem worse than it is
2) houses are unaffordable for many young people due to high prices and high interest rates so even tho the economy is good, they feel itâ€™s not working for them 
3) lots of free money handed out during the pandemic ended including student loans again now being due. So not getting free money is making them feel like theyâ€™ve lost income even tho it was just free money being taken away

Kind of an important 4.
The economy is better than it was during a global pandemic-caused recession and the inflation that followed. That hasn't fixed the fact that all basic living costs are 3-4x what they were a couple decades ago while wages are more like 1.5x what they were, and that heavily depends on your sector of the economy.
The house I bought for 120k in 2016 sold for 230k in 2020. It was worth 45k in 1995. The degree I have cost me $45k in-state; my dad got his at the same college for the price of a summer job's wages. Summer job paid rent, tuition, room, and board all year, all 4 years--no debt. About a decade after I graduated, that degree is closer to 65k.
And so on--my firstborn cost $15k for her birth. My mom paid $800ish.
It's not "social media" or "missing free money." That $1400 didn't go far. It's that life is exponentially more expensive than it was 20 years ago, and wages have not even come close to keeping up.

Inflation calculations don't include housing and food IIRC (well, not actual housing costs since they do that owner equivalent rent thing)
