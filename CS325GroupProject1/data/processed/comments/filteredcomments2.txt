After the last few chapters Kuma has become much more terrifying than his initial introduction.  If he wasn't a pacifist, between his natural bulk and his DF, the dude could have taken down the world

Yeah the guy is a monster. A cute cuddly teddy bear of a monster but a monster nonetheless.

That is exactly what popped in my mind when i saw the pic. It is incredible to see how Oda is able to alter our views of a single character and how we feel about them.

I don't collect any figures, but this one has me thinking about it.

Got curious and it was about 100-300$ when it was first available, all sold out of course or sketchy as hell sites since these figures always just sold for a limited time

Are all these legit sites to order from?

[â€“] fork_yuu 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Hell naw, looked sketchy as hell but they have prices. It's all sold out on those too.
Most sites for figures are sketchy as hell anyways, even the big ones like amiami you will have no support if anything happens
