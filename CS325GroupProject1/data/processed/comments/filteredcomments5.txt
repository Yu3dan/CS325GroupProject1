I house sat for a parrot who liked making noises like the front door being unlocked, shut, then the stairs creaking as someone walked up them. Then they would convincingly say â€œHello? Who is there?!? Answer me!â€� Freaky bird! Hearing at at 2am was enough to make the hairs on my neck stand up, even knowing it was the dang bird.
He would also make the phone ring noise and start conversations. I like birds but I could never live with one who does that!

Years ago I lived with someone who had a parrot. One day when I was walking by the living room and I saw it sitting on top of its cage. Wondering how it got out I went over to put the bird back in its cage and it bit me really hard making my hand bleed. As I was pressing some paper towels against my hand to stop the bleeding I heard the bird cackle, but like an evil villain from james bond. It then proceeded to climb down from the top and enter back into its own cage and laughed at me again as it stared at me from its perch. I've never trusted birds since then.

Actual villain origin story.

[â€“] Commentator-X 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 hour ago (1 child)
They may have been testing you. Iirc when they bite you like that they are checking to see how stable your arm or hand is for a perch. If you hold your ground and keep your arm stable, you gain its trust and it will allow you to pick them up/step on to your "perch". If you pull away they dont trust that you wont drop them.

[â€“] Shrodingers-Balls 2 points 3 points 4 points 27 minutes ago (0 children)
That is incorrect. That bird bit to hurt them. They do this knowingly and to people they do not know especially. If theyâ€™re holding on for support they arenâ€™t making you bleed. Signed: a person owned by a parrot.

My parents had an Amazon parrot back in the day and he was way too smart for his own good. He would mess with people all the time and he loved doing it. One day my mom and some friends watched this movie called Kaw, it was about these killer Ravens that terrorize a town. Well the bird must of heard the movie from the other room and picked up on the sound they would make before killing someone. He would make the sound late at night and then would laugh his ass off.

It may be funny to hear a bird say naughty words, but it warms my heart to see birds that only know positive things to say. Parrots love loud noise, and may enjoy their owners screaming for fun near them, but it takes a special kind of good person to ensure the screams  the parrot learns are "good boy!" and "pretty bird!" or laughing

[â€“] Mace_Windu- 29 points 30 points 31 points 2 hours ago (2 children)
If the title is true, then it is possible the bird is still grieving. The bond between parrot and owner is insanely tight which causes these long lived birds to grieve intensely. This can cause them to pluck their own feathers due to the stress.
Idk though. I can't really tell. Looks like they're just fluffed up having a good time making a noise that everyone else is responding to.

[â€“] InfernoidsorDie 6 points 7 points 8 points 2 hours ago (1 child)
I've seen birds that pick after losing a mate or an owner and they don't emote at all around people they don't have a good relationship with. Much less goof around and make a racket like that. Grandma probably had the bird around them and left them to a family member the bird is comfortable with which lowers the chance of it getting down and picking. I was really nervous opening up this video just seeing the caption but the way it was bouncing around I think it's in pretty good hands.

[â€“] Mace_Windu- 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 hour ago (0 children)
Yep that's a content parrot to floof and bounce in a room of people. Obviously loving the attention.

[â€“] CheckeredZeebrah 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 hour ago * (0 children)
Looks like a generally happy bird. He is bouncing around and emoting. Birds don't generally do this if they feel unwell. When visibly sick a bird will huddle up, squint their eyes, shiver, sit in one spot for long time periods, pick at a specific spot over and over again, or pace manically.
As for the video, this is normal goofy cockatoo behavior.

No one should ever own these parrots. Perfect example is Grandma dies and the parrot gets passed on to family that are going to be in a heck of an awakening to the needs of this cockatoo. Good luck.
Their noise actually requires hearing protection.

I cant and never like to see videos or pictures of dead loved ones because it hurts, so the idea of hearing a dead relatives laugh flying all over the house and around me would literally make me go insane, no thank you!

Parrots have developed the ability to "talk" as a system for communicating with us that they never use in the wild to communicate with each other.

I do not understand how birds are able to do this.  Thereâ€™s a raven somewhere on here today too.  How?

They have bird brains lolz. Part of their brain is geared toward song making. Those that mate for life come up with special calls to identify one another. Mimicry may help them in the wild in some way I don't know the particulars of. They are able to mimic human noises with an organ in their trachea called a syrinx.
African Greys are some of the best talkers. They tell jokes and and say things within context of what their owners say and their moods.
Animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg did a 30 year research on an African Grey named Alex and wrote a book called "Alex and Me". The bird had an over 100 word vocabulary and could answer questions geared toward a 2-6 year old.
I find the raven and crows way of talking a little uncanny. The can perform multistep puzzle tasks for food and have been known to aid wolves in the wild by spotting and alerting them to prey so they can eventually get the scraps. Crows will also remember a person that's wronged them and harass in retribution. They also remember kindness and will bring shiny trinkets as gifts.
The intelligent birds can be tricksters at times. It's fun to contemplate a birds sense of humor. There's a handful of youtube channels that feature African Greys (and other birds for that matter)

Two colleagues of mine - both ladies in their 50s at the time were best friends at work -  one had a parrot of some kind - she went on vacation for 2 weeks and asked her friend (colleague) to watch her parrot.
The parrot went psycho and bit half her ear off before bird-owner's plane had even landed in Aruba.  Her husband pulled the parrot off her, killed it, retrieved the piece of ear from its beak.
The parrot owner was so angry she'd lost her pet of 30 years that she sued the parrot babysitting lady and her husband for killing it. Ear-colleague counter-sued for damages (they weren't going to but the bird owner came at them hard).
Bird-sitter lady now has an ear that resembles an orc ear from Lord of The Rings and generally wears her hair down to cover it.
This was some of the most entertaining workplace action I've ever seen.  For months we couldn't help but laugh at it. And when I say laugh, nobody wanted to laugh at it but it was just one of those things that catches you off guard and you can't help it.   Even the kindest most empathetic colleagues couldn't help but burst into tears from laughing so hard at random times.
I've since changed companies and both of the ladies have retired, but 25 years later people in that office is still talking about that time.

We had a parrot growing up that mimicked the sound of the water dispenser in the fridge door. But when the bird mimicked the sound, it sounded exactly like the sound the aliens made in the movie Signs. It was terrifyingâ€¦ especially late at nightâ€¦

I used to have a parrot who imitated a smoke detector battery, sporadically and at random. Drove me up the wall.
He also used to make phone button dialing sounds, while I was in the process of dialing (back when cell phones did that), so it tripped me out and make me think I'd double-pressed a button or something and would start over. He nailed me with that one embarrassingly often.
Parrots are mischievous little shits.
