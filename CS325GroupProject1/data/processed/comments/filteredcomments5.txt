Depends on if Gege wants him to survive

[â€“] TryContent4093 21 points 22 points 23 points 2 days ago (1 child)
Yuta is always left out despite being the main character in jjk 0, being related to gojo and having the most powerful ct among the students. I doubt he can survive it

243 showed that he was actually training Bush Camping the whole story. That's why he was left out.

Using the space manipulation techniqueâ€¦.. to warp the slash that cuts space.
Based on the space cleaveâ€™s description, no.

[â€“] Muted_Lurker2383 22 points 23 points 24 points 2 days ago (6 children)
Depends specifically on how the technique works.
If Sky Manipulation works by moving the space (eg, this region you targetted is no longer at these co-ordinates, they are instead over there) then its possible. If what it does is control a vector (eg what seems like a straight path now actually has this curve in it that deflects the shot) its like Infinity and wont work.
Narratively, i doubt it. The build up since early days has been Yuji v Sukuna and Gojo v Sukuna. Would be weird to have Yuta be the one to end it all and with Gojo out of the picture it seems like it should be Yuji to beat Sukuna if he is to be beaten.

Narratively it makes no sense for Sukuna to lose but it is what it is

[â€“] uglyjackwagon 11 points 12 points 13 points 2 days ago (2 children)
Narratively? Gojoâ€™s students narratively are supposed to surpass him. Yuta is stronger than teen Gojo pre awakening, if he gets an awakening, itâ€™s not unbelievable to see him at relative strength.  Then you have the entire rest of the gang jumping Sukuna.
Yuji potentially has a unknown soul related ability, Maki has a sword that should be capable of doing damage, Angel still has nullification of techniques for her CT, and Megumi still has the potential to weaken Sukuna or be rescued, probably through Yujiâ€™s soul shenanigans.

The issue isn't what they have though, almost all sukunas's fights (where he is fully in control of is CE output) except gojo and maho have ended with the opponent getting one shot by cleave or dismantle. Yuji doesn't have RCT as far as we know currently so any attack he takes is lethal. Same with any character that's not yuta. Their is no potential for growth or awakening if you die in one hit.

[â€“] lverson -1 points 0 points 1 point 2 days ago (0 children)
Well, yes. With Gojo dead, anyone who lasts more than 10 seconds against Sukuna is only for the amusement of Sukuna and the narrative convenience of Gege. He can send 50 cleaves in the time in takes p much everyone else to move.

[â€“] Muted_Lurker2383 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
True theres not been much set up, but there are a few x factors in play to change relative power
Each of those has unestablished potential to tip things back in our protags favour

I really like how you delved deeper into the concept of infinity and sukuna's space slashâ�¤ï¸�

[â€“] TheBlackestIrelia 12 points 13 points 14 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Nah, i don't see how that would change anything

[â€“] VoidMageZero 6 points 7 points 8 points 2 days ago (2 children)
Not a dumb question, other people have asked it before too. My guess is Uro's technique would still be cut by Sukuna's upgraded cleave.

[â€“] Difficult_Guidance25 2 points 3 points 4 points 2 days ago (1 child)
Basically a bootleg infinity

[â€“] VoidMageZero 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Never thought of that but good way of putting it lol

[â€“] UnholyShite 8 points 9 points 10 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Uro's sky manipulation works kinda like Limitless, so it will still cut. Then again, it depends on Gege.

[â€“] Kookie2023 5 points 6 points 7 points 2 days ago (0 children)
That is a very good questionâ€¦we need a physicist to answer thisâ€¦
But I believe the answer is â€œNoâ€�. Sukuna cut through space itself with Mahoraga. Uro controlled the sky which is a bit of a different concept.

Is manga on break this week?

[â€“] Nathan_barrels [ S ] 2 points 3 points 4 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Nope

[â€“] floodedunit 2 points 3 points 4 points 2 days ago (0 children)
It will be next week. No new chapter December 10th

[â€“] Magnus_Carter0 2 points 3 points 4 points 2 days ago (0 children)
No, Sky Manipulation warps space, while Space Cleave essentially destroys space, so Uro's CT wouldn't help Yuta here unless there is something I'm missing

[â€“] J_the_Doofus 1 point 2 points 3 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Maybe but he'd have to see the slash coming first.

[â€“] MIL_1999 1 point 2 points 3 points 2 days ago (2 children)
Perhaps he could parry it with the right timing, wrap the space in a moment before it reach Yuta. But i don't think he could parry the Mango Cutter attack that killed Kashimo.

[â€“] Difficult_Guidance25 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (1 child)
I donâ€™t think that he could react to something Gojo couldnâ€™t and not just dodging but trying to parry it, but by the way weâ€™re going itâ€™s gonna turn out all of them where stronger than Gojo for some kind of reason

[â€“] MIL_1999 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 day ago (0 children)
Imo it's not that Gojo couldn't react, sukuna made him think that he has no way to bypass infinity without domain or mahoraga so he didn't dodge it. He was coned by sukuna.

[â€“] Raymenx 1 point 2 points 3 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Its possible, but no real way to tell. Comes down to how Geges interpretation of the logic ends up

[â€“] _S1syphus 1 point 2 points 3 points 2 days ago (0 children)
In theory, i dont see an issue. The universal slash targets the fabric of space itself and uro's technique distorts that same space, allowing free manipulation of it. I imagine sukuna would throw out the slash and instead of a perfect 180Â° imprint, it would look like he shaped the slash with drunk goggles. The counter would be the net technique he got kashimo with or MS if he wanted to instantly negate the technique

[â€“] Fruit_Punch666 1 point 2 points 3 points 2 days ago (0 children)
If Sukuna can slash the Limitless, then Uro's CT is nothing to be worried fo him.

[â€“] Ok_Membership_6559 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 day ago (0 children)
I'd say that before he adapted to Gojo's infinity, yes! They seem to actually be "invisible" but physical attacks that do travel through the air.
Now after he adapted I don't think so, Yuta would mold the space but Sukuna would just cut through it anyway, like a constant effect on reality.

[â€“] Precinho7 4 points 5 points 6 points 2 days ago (1 child)
Technically yes. He would bend the space around him to not be touched by Cleave.

[â€“] Nathan_barrels [ S ] 2 points 3 points 4 points 2 days ago (0 children)
That's what I was thinking. Not like redirect it how he did with Ryu but just move himself out of the way or something

[â€“] SoyMantequilla 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Didnâ€™t Uro fight Sukuna once already back in Heian era? Even if it works I donâ€™t think it helps him much as a counter, maybe just buys a little time. But I doubt it matters at all against malevolent shrines spam of normal attacks

[â€“] The_Stang 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
I'd say yes, because you are bending space. So even if he is targeting "space" itself you are able to take that space and move it. But it is confusing because he still has to "send" the space cleave

[â€“] TPJchief87 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Seems like itâ€™d be a better idea to just dodge it

[â€“] DudeWhereAreWe1996 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
The issue is it doesn't seem to shoot out. When you look at when he used it on Kashimo we see the cut instantly start where Kashimo was. That's the reason it was able to get Gojo I think. Since it didn't have to travel anywhere and instead went straight to Gojo. I think some more explaining from Gege would help but I guess that'll come later or in an author note.

[â€“] kiseobito021 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Sukuna can now cut whatver the fk he wants to cut cuz Gege is a genius.

[â€“] BirdMBlack 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Depends on whichever Gege decides has higher priority. Either Sukuna's slash tears through its predetermined area of attack with extreme prejudice and ignores Uro's technique, or it's able to be bent away because it occupies the space being altered by her technique. We can't know for sure how it'll play out until it happens because it's highly dependent on how the author wants it to play.

[â€“] Independent_Leek1751 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Not really. He controls space sure but sukuna can cut through that space and I will be honest with you. Sukuna with all the honesty in the world should mob the floor with everyone in the series right now. Except maybe kenjaku ( low diff ) the rest is low to no diff. But another Almighty in the way.

[â€“] saltedmints 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
It would depend on how cursed techniques worklike Kenjaku said if they are their own reality when being used or if there is a background system to everything that kinda determines it.When he talked with Mahito when Geto's body choked him.
As Gojo is creating space and Uro is manipulating space

[â€“] Normal_Ad_2717 0 points 1 point 2 points 2 days ago (0 children)
Nope I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything that can repel that attack except maybe  hollow purple

[â€“] folgerscoffees 0 points 1 point 2 points 21 hours ago (0 children)
it depends on if Gege is having a bad day or not
