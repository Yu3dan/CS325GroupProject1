I think there is an interesting point here for how much Devil Fruit abilities should count.
Zoro is unquestionably the better swordsman compared to Law, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that he would win that matchup.
Because of the multifaceted nature of the power system, weapon proficiency can often be completely circumvented by Haki or Devil Fruit abilities.
Like give Luffy a sword and no one will say he is a great swordsman, yet his Conq Haki would shut down any low tier combatant.
But for Zoro, I think that itâ€™s more of a symbolic thing. Mihawk is generally regarded as the best swordsman, so it is him SPECIFICALLY that Zoro needs to beat in order to achieve his goal.
The pupil must surpass the master.

[â€“] nobarachinsama Cipher Pol 79 points 80 points 81 points 1 month ago (18 children)
mihawk is not the best swordsman. he's the strongest. it's written exactly like WB. and since the introduction of haki, being the "better swordsman" is a non factor.
when zoro fought pica, he admitted that he wouldn't be able to cut pica without having stronger haki . so without haki, his santoryu wouldn't even be able to beat pica. that's how far "pure swordsmanship" matters in the current power system.
if zoro couldn't beat law in full on fight, then law is the stronger swordsman. it's not about swordsmanship. just about besting the other swordsman.

[â€“] ButItWasMeDio 25 points 26 points 27 points 1 month ago (9 children)
Haki is important but it's not everything. Vergo and Pica specialize in being Haki tanks, Big Mom and Kaido are great at it too because they have to be great at everything.
But otherwise it's not like Armament makes one 100% immune to any attack with even slightly weaker Haki. If that was the case Haki users would be fully immune to environmental damage (falling debris, high falls) which is not the case, and a Haki-less Luffy beat the Boa sisters.
If it was just Haki Zoro wouldn't even parry sword slashes, he would just take them head-on through superior Haki. Sanji's iron skin would be pointless too

[â€“] nobarachinsama Cipher Pol 15 points 16 points 17 points 1 month ago (7 children)
it's not about haki being everything, but the fact that there's no point in separating "pure swordsmanship" on its own. let alone at the level that we are now. I'm not talking pre ts.
zoro didn't perfect his onigiri. the technique has remained the same for 20 years. what's different is zoro's base strength, speed, haki when executing this move.
"pure swordsmanship" is just onigiri as a technique. how does it matter without the person executing it being strong? which is stronger, wano's zoro casual haki slash, or baratie's zoro sanzen sekai?
tashigi can have better sword techniques than law. but what does that matter? unless tashigi has the strength, speed, and haki that could match law, she's not gonna do anything with all that skills.

[â€“] Dustfinger4268 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (6 children)
I understand, but also disagree. Yes, the characters as a whole have gotten physically stronger, and have advanced their haki to emphasize that strength. However, that strength alone isn't enough either. His onigiri hasn't changed much, sure, but that's a move he's had for almost as long as he's used the three sword style. Of course he's come close to nearly perfecting that one, to the point he doesn't even really need 3 swords. He did it with a scythe during Wano, which shows a pretty good mastery of the move to be able to complete it with a nearly completely foreign weapon. Some of his other moves have shown growth over the course of the show, though. His flying slash, for example, has gone through several changes, from requiring a lot of strength and essentially only being able to deliver full strength slashes, to having the precision to only cut one target.

[â€“] nobarachinsama Cipher Pol 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (5 children)
no yeah, I understand. but in the end, it doesn't really matter when you separate it on its own. that's the whole point.
look, just answer me this. when mihawk cuts a ship, what matters more. the way he swings his sword, or the strength behind it?
which one caused the slash to be that strong? can tashigi do it just by learning the technique? or she has to have the strength to back it up?
this is not some historical medieval story about knights where the way you swing your sword matters. we're talking about superhuman destroying mountains with their fist. we're talking god fruits and conqueror's haki.







[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 month ago (0 children)
yes.
My point of view on this issue would be, that Law and Zoro are roughly on the same powerlevel. I'd be even willing to give Law an edge here.
Law does have good sword skills and a DF.
Zoro only uses his sword skills.
For me that means, that zoro has to be the better swordsman, because he can keep up with Law without having a DF. I completely ignored Haki here, but Haki is important to both of their fighting styles and shouldnt change to much.

[â€“] Kirosh2 Lookout 127 points 128 points 129 points 1 month ago * (58 children)
That depends on how strong Mihawk is. If Miihawk is on the levels of proper Emperors, then it's still pretty far for Zoro.
But if he isn't as strong as them, then Zoro will get there soon.

[â€“] Cocabonzao 34 points 35 points 36 points 1 month ago (22 children)
He is closer to Yonkou than people think tbh. Pre King of Hell Zoro scared the shit out of Big Mom with Flying Dragon Twister...She even told Kaido to be careful with him. Also, 1.1 billion berries is a very  low bounty for current Zoro and so is Sanji's 1.032 billion berries very low.
Jinbe's current bounty is inflated af, dude has a bounty bigger than Katakuri's.
I'd say he needs 2 or 3 more close fights to be relative to Mihawk, improve armament, Conqueror's and observation and obviously gives us a preview or full out reveal of King Of Hell Ashura. That shit is terrifying to imagine. If I were to rank him as a swordsman, I think he is number 5 and has surpassed Vista already.

[â€“] Cocabonzao 20 points 21 points 22 points 1 month ago (1 child)

Where do you think Vista fits on this list. Havenâ€™t seen him mentioned in this thread. While I donâ€™t think heâ€™s top 5, I do think heâ€™s probably close in strength to current Zoro, maybe a little weaker idk we havenâ€™t seen enough of him to know, but heâ€™s definitely worth including in this discussion imo

[â€“] Cocabonzao 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago * (0 children)
I'd place him at 7. Reason he his not higher is because we haven't seen him since War of The Best. And the Whitebeard pirates did lose Marineford and War of The Best, while he has good swordsmanship, I don't think its anywhere close to Law (he would be 6th) or Zoro. They have too much hax and monstrous growth going for them. Vista might have fought Shiryu and lost, there's that too.
This conversation would get cancerous real quick if we considered dead and alive swordsman. Mihawk would probably be 2nd or 3rd

[â€“] DatGameGuy 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 month ago (3 children)
Jinbe's bounty is inflated only if you view bounty's as power scaling tools which they are not, they measure threat to the WG.  Jinbe's bounty makes sense because of his status with the Fishmen making him far more influential in the world than Sanji is.
While Sanji can hit harder than Jinbe, Jinbe can inspire the Fishmen to rebel against the WG which is a much larger threat.

[â€“] Cocabonzao 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago * (2 children)
Sure, but Sanji is from a royal family that had a seat in the Reverie, so he is technically a WG traitor....And not just a normal.Royal family, but one that's tech savy and the greatest military power in the North Blue.

[â€“] DatGameGuy 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (1 child)
Yes but heâ€™s an outcast within that family.  Judge hardly cares about what happens to Sanji.
A big theme of One Piece is about how blood ties donâ€™t necessarily make two people family and thats very clear with Sanji and Judge.  Sanji likely holds little to no sway over Judgeâ€™s decision making unless what Sanji wants is convenient for Judge.

[â€“] Cocabonzao 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (0 children)

[â€“] TotallyFakeEngineer 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (1 child)
I think Jinbe is not inflated but more like he already got a head start in pirating before most of the straw hat crew. Hence the higher bounty

[â€“] Cocabonzao 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 month ago (0 children)
Only good argument for that was that he was a former warlord, but then again, that bounty raise should have happened in Marineford, when he officially resumed pirating, not in Wano.

[â€“] uswhole 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (6 children)

[â€“] Cocabonzao 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (5 children)
Its inflated in the sense it should not be in between Zoro and Sanji. Both Zoro and Sanji deserved somewhere between 1.4 and 1.2 berries. If the bounties were like that there wouldn't be a problem Jinbe was 1.1 billion. I agree he has more experience but not a longer or better resume. WG even ommited Alabasta and Thriller Bark from the general public?

[â€“] uswhole 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (0 children)
Robin had higher bounty when she joined I do not  think its really that off.

[â€“] Bidenbro1988 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (3 children)
Zoro deserves a ~2 billion bounty like Crocodile because what he did on the roof does not indicate that heâ€™s only a Yonko commander level threat and Yonko commanders definitely donâ€™t go and 1 shot other Yonko commanders while severely injured the moment they decide to go for their best attack. Itâ€™s likely nothing was reported other than his victory over King.
Sanji hasnâ€™t done anything to deserve a higher bounty, but the speed at which he kicked the crap out of Queen once he got this shit together indicates that he should probably be able to do something that gets him a ~2 billion bounty too.
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s inappropriate for the WG to put a Yonko commanderâ€™s bounty on Jinbei after his reported accomplishments at WCI and Wano. If Luffy is a Yonko, Jinbeiâ€™s probably the first big name youâ€™d associate with him as his commander.
I think Zoro and Sanjiâ€™s current bounties are fine. They didnâ€™t demonstrate the full extent of their ability, so itâ€™s good to save up some cards for the next big jump. It would be unexciting if Zoro and Sanji just fought more of the same, a stronger class of Yonko commanders like Shiryu and Crocodile. Theyâ€™ll likely surpass Luffyâ€™s current bounty with the last bounties they get before the final battle.

[â€“] Cocabonzao 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (2 children)
That's actually a good take, can't argue with that...But imagine if it was like that? Luffy's bounty also wouldn't be 3 Billion, more like 4 to 5 billion.

[â€“] Bidenbro1988 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (1 child)
Oh yeah, I think Luffy is still being underestimated. I think the WG tried to cover up how much of a threat this â€œwarrior of liberationâ€� is by splitting the bounty 3 billion even with Kid and Law.
Iâ€™m expecting Kizaru to have something bananas up his sleeve since they explicitly mentioned that Garp and admirals were 3 billion to the Cross Guild and Luffyâ€™s opponents usually exceed his bounty instead of match it. Either that or Kizaru alone isnâ€™t his final opponent and Jay Garcia or Blackbeard might cut in.
Bounty is usually like a hype WWE title card and Kizaru is an unclear character instead of a straight big boss or archenemy.

[â€“] Cocabonzao 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (0 children)
I think Saint Jay is going to become the prisioner of a crew. I don't know if its Blackbeard or SH's because both are interessting possibilities and would have a huge impact on the plot and be an unprecedented incident in the WG history, one of the Five Elders is taken hostage by a pirate crew. As for Kizaru, I think he will have to choose between captuing objectives or fighting Luffy at 100% and risk losing power plant as collateral damage. I.agree with you WG definetly tried to cover it up, and that's why there was a problem with the bounty picture when it was issued

If Mihawk and Shanks really used to duel equally, then Mihawk should be Emperor level. Its not like he got weaker.

[â€“] Kirosh2 Lookout 7 points 8 points 9 points 1 month ago (2 children)
That's not a good argument.
Mihawk might be Emperor Level, but it isn't because he used to duel eaqually with Shanks.
Keep in mind that their Duels were at least 13 years ago, and that Shanks only became an Emperor 6 years ago.
That a long time with a lot that can change in the middle.
For example, Lucci used to be near the same level as Luffy in Enies Lobby. But now he's far outmatched by Luffy. Since they had a different level of growth.

[â€“] NopileosX2 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 month ago (0 children)
I think just by holding the title one has to set Mihawk close to Emperor level. He is the best at something in a world full of very strong creatures. He got no crew and does as he pleases in a very hostile world.
But in the end it is One Piece and gladly power ranking never really worked in this series. So we need to wait and see Mihawk really getting pushed in a battle to know how strong he is.



[â€“] Terium Pirate 14 points 15 points 16 points 1 month ago (0 children)
I've always seen Mihawk as Yonko level, he'd been dueling Shanks for fun all those years and didn't want to continue after he lost his arm because it'd be either dishonorable or like a handicap. He's also portrayed as someone outside of the established system even if he is considered a pirate. He had no crew and no ambitions to become a Yonko but he could very much be one if he wanted to. I honestly think he's still above Luffy as well.

Thatâ€™s the thing though, one could assume that Mihawk is the greatest swordsman because he has a black blade, only uses his sword and went after swordsman to establish his title.

Mihawk's willpower is probably off the charts.  And he probably gets an boost in willpower/haki just from believing he's the world's strongest.
I'm not sure why anyone would ever underestimate Mihawk.  That said, I want to see a hypothetical fight between Mihawk and Kaido.  I wonder if he'd get speed-blitzed by Kaido or if he'd be able to keep up and for how long.
Shanks is constantly trying to duel Mihawk and Kaido is constantly seeking out strong opponents but all Mihawk seems to be interested in is napping in the East Blue.  Homie's skills are gonna slip if he keeps avoiding strong opponents.

Lmao what, Mihawk never beat Shanks. They stopped fighting after Shanks lost his arm.
They were equal years ago, before Shanks became a Yonko.
Mihawk refuses to duel Shanks because if he wins, it is because his opponent has only one arm. If he lost, it is a fucking embarrassment to lose to someone with one arm as the World's Strongest Swordsman. Aside from that, Mihawk is a tsundere and he denies it but he considers Shanks as his friend and Shanks also considers him as such. It was stated before that a duel between swordsmen for Mihawk's title, is a duel to the death so there's also that.

I wouldn't say law is stronger because of his swordsmanship, more like his df makes him a very difficult target, offense wise too it's the df that makes him have a weird type of offense.
But overall I'd say yeah he's stronger but if we talk about pure swordsmanship no df I'd put Zoro above law.

[â€“] Regulai 43 points 44 points 45 points 1 month ago (7 children)
Even with DF I'd put Zoro above law. It'd be like Vergo, it would come down simply to who has stronger haki and after mastering conq I think Zoro has the best on this field. He's also much more of a fighter, compared to the trickster law.

[â€“] Opposite_Increase_38 12 points 13 points 14 points 1 month ago (0 children)
In addition to better haki, Zoro also has faster reaction time (hakai in chapter 1009) and movement speed (brief 1v1s against Kaido in chapter 1010). Law has better utility, making him more valuable in a team fight, but Zoro is better in a 1v1.

I think Law would have an extremely high chance of losing if he was in Zoroâ€™s condition and failed to kill King immediately with k-room or radio knife because King would switch to speed 100% of the time and Law would be nowhere near fast enough to stop himself from being beaten to shit while he was that injured. I do not see Law surviving the fight even if he wins unless he 1 shots King at the start. Even Zoroâ€™s survival was iffy there.

[â€“] HokiArt 9 points 10 points 11 points 1 month ago (7 children)
That's what I'm saying too, and they are not the swordsmen stronger than him, they are fighters stronger than him, they never call themselves swordsmen, that's a distinction that was made clear in Zoro vs King, even Rayleigh says it's been a while since he used his sword, that too after he entered the fight meaning he doesn't usually use it for combat which isn't something a swordsman would say since that's the only way a swordsman would fight
A lot of the serious swordsman characters have been shown to only use swords as a means of fighting and not DFs like vista, oden, Zoro, tashigi, Mihawk, this is also the reason I don't consider law to be a swordsman.

[â€“] dtc09 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 month ago (6 children)
law and fujitora have been called swordsmen by oda so there's that
<image>
rayleigh just meant he's been a long time without fighting, as he retired
king doesn't even have an actual sword, so yeah he obviously isn't a swordsman, but characters that have only been seen fighting with their sword like ray and shanks are obviously swordsmen (btw, shanks also has a graded blade like zoro's, called gryphon)

[â€“] HokiArt 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 month ago (0 children)
but characters that have only been seen fighting with their sword like ray and shanks are obviously swordsmen
This exact logic is what I used to differentiate that law is not strong by swordsmanship but by df usage.
Like I said before, discussion is about pure swordplay, no one's saying Zoro is stronger than law or Rayleigh or even fujitora, I'm pretty sure if all Mihawk wanted was a fight then shanks is more than capable of giving him one, Mihawk refuses to fight him purely because he won't be as skilled as a swordsman anymore now that he's lost a hand.

I don't think Law is as strong as Zoro regardless. Especially post Wano.
Law's really a DF dependant trickster type who focusing on using his DF special properties.
Pure haki fighters who actually block and dodge (unlike BM) are the worst type for him to fight, because unless he has stronger Haki (e.g. vergo) then he will just lose to them. Now Law's haki isn't weak, but I don't think he's on Zoro's level here anymore. Zoro is someone who's haki Kaido/Big mom need to dodge to not take critical blows from.

he's still pretty far from mihawk though, shanks oneshotting someone close to him in power solidifies that
Not disagreeing with the general assessment, but imo the attack he missed on Kaido might oneshot Kidd just as well, especially with ACoC. It cut cleanly through the massive stone horn, it should do the same to the scap metal cannon (and arguably the whole ship).

Someone I see being left out of this discussion is Vista. We havenâ€™t seen nearly enough of him to know how strong he is, but I think Zoro vs Vista would be a pretty good matchup

At this point, Marco is the closest matchup. Among actual swordsmen, it would be Smoothie. Regardless, he's seemingly surpassed all the Yonko commanders.

[â€“] dzak92 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 month ago (1 child)
But Whitebeard didnâ€™t even have a first mate so I think this line of thinking is pointless. He had his 16 commanders, and despite what the numbering may suggest doesnâ€™t necessarily indicate strength. The Whitebeard pirates were more of a loosely defined family as opposed to a power scaled organization. All we know is Vista was a commander which is the highest achievable subordinate rank, and he was able to at least stall Mihawk (who wasnâ€™t serious) for a little while. I wouldnâ€™t bet against Zoro in a 1v1 a giant Vista but I think itâ€™d be a lot closer than most would give credit for.

There's absolutely no way Law could beat Zoro without his devil fruit, so no, he's not a stronger swordsman. I think Fujitora would also probably be unable to beat Zoro without using his devil fruit, so I think Zoro is ahead of him too.

We really need a flashback of shanks and mihawk dueling  at full power so we can see just how strong mihawk is, I feel like he's rarely ever trying so it's impossible to judge how strong he actually is. With he title of strongest swordsman in the world I would assume in a one on one he can beat or drqw with almost anyone

Kaido vs Mihawk would have been a dope fight!
Mihawk might actually be the reason why the crossguilds Yonko status is justified.

[â€“] Strawhat-Lupus 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 month ago (0 children)
Cross guild status is justified solely based off of Buggy's feats. Being on the OG pirate kings ship, breaking out of impel down with another Yonko, being sworn brothers with Red hair, another Yonko.
He was made a yonko because of his connection. To the WG, he has Mihawk, Crocodile, Luffy and Shanks and any remaining Pirate king remnants in his friend circle. That team alone dwarfs the firepower that Kaido or big mom could output with their crews.
So yea, Mihawk being in the guild helps but it's the reasoning he is in the guild and how the WG sees it.



[â€“] HokiArt 36 points 37 points 38 points 1 month ago (7 children)

[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 7 points 8 points 9 points 1 month ago (6 children)
Putting shanks aside (beating him is most likely luffy's job) who do you think he has to beat in the time that is left? My guess would be (after reading some comments) Shiriyu, Fujitora and Mihawk

[â€“] HokiArt 13 points 14 points 15 points 1 month ago (3 children)
I mean if Mihawk is shanks (aka yonko) level I'll have to say he needs to beat atleast an admiral level character for zoro to even be considered a contender for the title of the wss but I think he'll probably fight shiryu then fight Mihawk and level up mid fight and win extreme diff.

[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 3 points 4 points 5 points 1 month ago (2 children)

[â€“] seanjohnson9 8 points 9 points 10 points 1 month ago (1 child)
Iâ€™m a bit confused at some of the comments here. Zoroâ€™s dream isnâ€™t JUST to beat Mihawk, itâ€™s to become the worlds greatest swordsman.
A lot of people are saying â€œwell it depends on if Mihawk is as strong as X character.â€� Well if Mihawk is NOT as strong as X character, then beating him wonâ€™t allow Zoro to achieve his dreamâ€¦ I thought Mihawk was still considered THE greatest swordsman, hence why he represents that pinnacle for Zoro. Am I missing something?

[â€“] ProtoReaper23113 6 points 7 points 8 points 1 month ago (0 children)
No you got it right on the head even if mihawkis the best in the world i still dont think it would be enough for zoro, personally i fell like even after he beats mihawk he would still train and strive to be better, once your at the top everyone comes for you

[â€“] Shot_Common_860 5 points 6 points 7 points 1 month ago (0 children)
I believe Mihawk might be a top tier haki user, and probably around Roger/Shanks level, so Zoro is definitely not there yet. Zoro definitely needs advanced observation (Mihawk probably has) and upgrade all his Haki. Mihawk has the strongest sword, imagine how strong his Haki should be... Zoro few chapters ago was about to die because of ENMA (that is not even close to Yoru). Probably 2/3 powerups, learn to control his Haki better and upgrade his swords, and Zoro reaches Mihawk level.

[â€“] ObberGobb 18 points 19 points 20 points 1 month ago (2 children)
Looking at pure swordsmen, Mihawk and Shanks are definitely above him. Shanks one-shot Kid, who is probably stronger than Zoro, and Mihawk is at the very least equal to Shanks. He's definitely below Rayleigh, as Rayleigh could fight Kizaru and was viewed as a threat by Blackbeard.
He is probably below Garling as well. I saw probably because Garling really only has the hype of his position going for him, and hasn't actually fought anyone significant. His position should still put him solidly above Zoro though, I expect him to be roughly on the level of Admirals. Like with Garling, the Gorosei with the sword (assuming he is actually a combatant and its not just a ceremonial sword) should be above him too. Shiryu should also be above him by virtue of his position as Blackbeard's 2nd in command.
He's also weaker than Law, but Law has a DF so might not count.

[â€“] CreativeFeedback8809 4 points 5 points 6 points 1 month ago (0 children)
He is in the top 1% of swordsmen.
If it was no df, pure swords, he would probably be top 10 possibility top 5.
Those that are better than him are basically Shanks, Mihawk, Shiryu, and possibly some others we haven't seen fight yet like the elder stars. There is also the Mihawk seraphim, but i dont think it's more skilled it just has better hax.
Edit: I forgot about Rayleigh

[â€“] Crazyhands96 The Revolutionary Army 6 points 7 points 8 points 1 month ago (2 children)
I think heâ€™s a lot closer than people are giving him credit for. There isnâ€™t much time left in the story for Zoro to grow stronger and Mihawk isnâ€™t gonna be Zoroâ€™s final fight(unless Mihawk rejoins the government for some reason) so itâ€™s gotta happen somewhat soon.
If youâ€™re obsessed with strict power scaling then Zoro with most of his bones broken was able overwhelm Hybrid Kaido in a clash and leave a permanent scar on him. He also handily defeated King after unlocking ACoC, like 3 hits and King(who had taken no damage prior to that) was down. Zoro is well above commander level rn and could probably give an Admiral a solid right.
The only powerups left for Zoro that we know for sure heâ€™ll get are Black Blades and maybe greater mastery if Asura. He may get other Haki abilities or a better sword but thatâ€™s up in the air.
All that being said I give it 1-2 more arcs max before Zoro becomes WSS.

soon honestly & hot take, i think zoro should be the first to accomplish his dream.
he was the first straw hat who actually had a shot at his dream in the beginning of the series vs Mihawk & failed. Kinda showed to crew, particularly Sanji, that chasing your dream is real & u can actually have a shot at it.
even recently in the live action u saw how zoros fight w/mihawk brought the crew much closer together w/the theme surrounding around going after your dreams/goals

[â€“] DankudeDabstorm 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (0 children)
I mean Zoro wounded Kaido and beat King. Heâ€™s basically at or at the cusp of Yonko level, so the only people who can give him a challenge are admirals, yonko, strongest commanders, and former warlords.

[â€“] AsuraOkami Pirate 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (0 children)
I would like to say he is maybe like 70% the way towards his goal of strongest swordsmen.   His growth in wano is showcase of how close he is getting towards being the best.

[â€“] Spirited-Ad2568 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (0 children)

[â€“] YourHeroKuroShiYo 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (0 children)

[â€“] Paintedenigma 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago * (0 children)
He is close. We have essentially been told that Mihawk is on the same level as the Emperors in terms of pure combat power. His bounty, and reputation vs. shanks and others speaks to that. Zoro is at a level where he is a serious threat to emperor level fighter, he just lacked the individual stamina and durability to specifically defeat kaidou.
That said I think on his own, mihawk is likely weaker than Shanks or Kaidou, I doubt we will see any individual person who matches Kaidou in terms of raw power and durability, given his moniker as strongest creature.
If Shanks was simply unilaterally stronger than Kaidou, I find it difficult to believe that he would have allowed Wano to suffer for so long, given that Oden was a close friend.
Similarly I think that Mihawk is easily Yonko level, but I doubt he has the raw power and durability of Kaidou, or Haki nearly as powerful as Shanks.
I would say that Zoro will likely be on Mihawks level in terms of skill after Elbaf. After that he will like likely acquire or create one or more supreme grade swords, and that will likely be what puts him on the even footing with Mihawk finally.
I would say that is unlikely that Zoro is currently in the top 5, but somewhat likely that he is in the top 10, and almost certain that he is in the top 15 when you consider there may be fighters in groups like the Holy Knights and Giant Pirates whom we know nothing about at this point.

[â€“] hesawavemasterrr 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (0 children)

Power scaling for shanks and Mihawk and even Zoro is tough.
Imo Zoro is stronger than law and kid.
Shanks one shots kid.
Mihawk couldn't lay a scratch on Jozu
Zoro scarred kaido.
Shanks was putting strong effort.
Mihawk was merely testing his level but definitely put in some strength.
Zoro put max effort while at his limit.
Zoro is Top 10 swords man for sure. We consider anyone a swordman if they carry a sword. Then we rank them based on haki if they primarily carry a sword.
Big mom was technically a swords woman.



[â€“] Pengu105 2 points 3 points 4 points 1 month ago (1 child)
To become the best I believe Zoro still has to defeat these 3 from this point on:
I would say Shanks simply because he has a sword, but he's not exactly a "swordsman" imo, he's more of an emporor/haki user.

Which swordsmen could still be better than Zoro?
Mihawk (obviously)
Shanks (obviously)
Fujitora (obviously)
Ethanbaron (most likely, but not enough feats)
Figarland Garling (most likely, but not enough feats)
Rayleigh (probably, but he is old)
Shiryu (maybe, but not enough feats)
Vista (most likely not, but still possible)
So I would put Zoro at 7th place, between Rayleigh and Shiryu.

Zoro is my favorite character, but saying that he could take an attack by two Yonkos is way overstating what he did. He stood in front and withheld it for a few seconds till Law could move them out of the way and it broke nearly all of his bones.

IMO he's only behind Mihawk, Shanks and possibly Rayleigh.
Law and Fujitora are both possibly still stronger than him, but they rely on their DF alot, so in pure swordsmanship Zoro still takes the W.
There's still plenty of characters who are still stronger than him, but in pure swordsmanship Zoro is already top 5.

It depends on your view.
To me Mihawk is the strongest swordsman even though Shanks is stronger than him and he uses a sword.
But I believe shanks is not in the competition for that goal so he can be excluded.
And yes, technically shanks is a swordsman but I still believe for that ( let's call it a story arc ) Shanks does not matter.
And I also personally don't know if Zoro will ever fight Mihawk. Could also be that Shiryuu kills Mihawk. But I do believe EOS Zoro will be stronger than Prime Mihawk by logic.
And since we are close to the end, Zoro is still close to his goal even if in terms of strength he might only be halfway there yet (just and example percentage not my actual one). Because Zoro will grow each arc the amount he has too.

I think Oda would make alot of his fans angry if Shiriyu just backstabs mihawk without zoro and him having a rematch first.

Well to be fair, he always makes some fans angry with his decisions.
Look how much hate Gear5 got when it was introduced but now its mayoritly loved.
There will always be haters but if you follow the story enough Zoro doesn't need to fight Mihawk to achieve his goal in my eyes.

[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 month ago (2 children)
true. Oda is a great author and one piece is almost impossible to powerscale. Also story > fights.
I'd still be a lil sad tho

[â€“] Reyzour 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (1 child)
Powerscaling is stupid in a story manga anyway. :D
If its lighthearted it can be fun but generally speaking its not at all light hearted on this subreddit and people claim their opinions as facts why to much :D
I personally do see a setting where it makes sense for us to see Zoro vs Mihawk. Because why would Mihawk be on the opposite side for any of the remaining battles. And I do not think Oda would do a post story fight just for Zoro. :D

True :D
this isn't DBZ. people tend to forget that

Probably not close to Mihawk and what I mean is he is a lot closer than he was from the first fight but if they fought again Mihawk still wouldn't need to use a named attack and since Mihawk and Shanks are equivalent or one is stronger than the other

[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 month ago (4 children)
currently zoro would definetly still lose, but how much growth does he have to do now. He has obviously come far since Baratie, but how many fights are inbetween now and him besting Mihawk?

[â€“] Consistent-Macaron22 -1 points 0 points 1 point 1 month ago (3 children)
Maybe some years of intense training can help him get closer

[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 month ago (2 children)
but hasn't the entire east blue saga taken place in less then a year? I dont think post time skip has been a year yet either.
with him still having to train for years, he wouldn't be able to achieve his dream even with Luffy being king of the pirates. not in the mainstory at least.

[â€“] Consistent-Macaron22 1 point 2 points 3 points 1 month ago (1 child)
Oh yeah your right well maybe in the same year Luffy becomes pirate king Zoro might achieve his goal

[â€“] NeverFacecheck [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 month ago (0 children)
yeah, I think most of the crew will achieve their goal at roughly the same time. Even tho we still need to learn about luffy's real goal, that comes after becoming king of the pirates.

He's #17 exactly and Oda personally told me that he will have to fight a king of the hill style battle in the style of the end of "the One" to prove he's the strongest swordsmen and be crowned by the pirate king with the title.

If movie can be considered as fact, Mihawk still far ahead of Zoro.
Zoro released his strongest attack vs Meteor. The meteor split into 2.
Mihawk effortlessly destroyed that meteor.

movies can not be considered canon.
