This is common sense for most people. The only ones who are unaware are those at the top, who only view their staff as tools to meet their corporate goals.
MAPPA got too greedy. They acquired all these big name IPs (AOT final season, CSM, and JJK) and thought they were invincible. Now everyone is losing, thanks to their arrogance.
I just hope the outcome of all this attention is the workers finally getting some rest and better conditions, and I hope it comes sooner than later. Literally put the season on hold ASAP, if things have gotten this bad. We fans can wait.

Don't get your hopes up. All you'll get is disappointment. Plus I doubt the guys at MAPPA will let the workers rest.

It's crazy that even though its unfinished, this is the single best episode I've seen this year. These are literally *the* best animators in the world. I am stunned by their talent.

Now imagine if they had time

It is so sad that such talented people don't even got something that simple as rest for their peak work :3

People are still gonna watch it anyways lol,they can always throw another bone like Hidden Inventory which had pretty good animation quality.

Like Nobara, you hit the nail on the head.
JJK definitely has the potential to make history here however if the episodes decline in quality, well thatâ€™s how the series will appear to viewers forever, tarnishing the incredible work weâ€™ve already seen. Iâ€™m so worried about it and ofc I put the welfare of MAPPA workers first, I wish they had just delayed releasing it. They probably would have made even more money from the series if each episode was the same level of quality and they had happy animators.

Yâ€™all are dragging it only some scenes looked unfinished and thats understandable due to the rest of the fight being so well animated and work conditions

[â€“] ancapwr [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 10 hours ago (2 children)
No. Itâ€™s gotten worse and worse since the fight with Choso.

[â€“] delerio2 5 points 6 points 7 points 9 hours ago (1 child)
well no cause the fight vs Jogo was well done. In the last episode most of it was well done but then some incomplete moments appeared (like the shrine not being fully shown)

[â€“] IndividualAd5795 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)
Sukuna vs Jogo is an exception because itâ€™s production was somewhat isolated from the rest of the episodes.

That's what I have been saying since Shibuya started. People are now only starting to speak.

[â€“] ancapwr [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 7 hours ago (6 children)
At the beginning it was very good. But this week is where mappa really disrespected everyone.

I kinda seen it coming since the start of the current Arc, and I have made some comments on this very sub. What pains me is that JJK fans seemed to be not very demanding and were to attached to the anime that they overlooked the real issues with it. Now this happened.
I still find the episode a masterpiece in a lot of regards, but it's not at part with expectations, especially in contrast with S1 consistancy.

[â€“] ancapwr [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (4 children)
I am also very attached and tbh itâ€™s okay, it doesnâ€™t have to be perfect, but decency has a limit. I accepted that the episode inside Dagonâ€™s domain was off because they had to make it sunny, the color palette was different and stuff but nowâ€¦ Mahoraga is so iconic and I really looked forward to this fightâ€¦ I felt like crying

[â€“] TpuGfakuta300 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (3 children)
I guess a lot of people do too. JJK fans were done dirty.
For me I kinda found the first 10 minutes better than I expected. Maybe because I got used to this quality now and I know we won't see something as consistent as in S1 looks.

[â€“] ancapwr [ S ] 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (2 children)
I also felt like the first minutes were ok. S1 and Hidden Inventory were amazing. With Shibuya arc, in my opinion, only the Choso episode and the one with Nanami-Haruta were good.

[â€“] TpuGfakuta300 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (0 children)
Exactly!

[â€“] Alarming_Industry_14 0 points 1 point 2 points 33 minutes ago (0 children)
Eh this is wrong. Mechamaru vs Mahito, Gojos sealing, Toji vs Dagon, Toji vs Megumi, Sukuna vs Jogo and despite the unfinished product, the Mahoraga episode, are just great episodes on par if not better than anything in S1.
I know is more inconsistent than S1 overall, but is so FAR AWAY from being a case like One Punch Man season 2 or the tragedy that was Seven Deadly Sins season 3

U say the animators work is being trashed...but it's not by shueisha or toho or mappa that's trashing the animation. It's the fans that have gotten to spoiled on great animation over the last few yrs. I'm starting to think the animators r preemptively saying that they could've done better if given better working conditions to make sure the Fandom dnt target them with their unwarranted complaints. If it was me as long as my actual boss ain't coming to me like "yo u need to tighten up ur shit looking unfinished and choppy and sloppy!" Then I wouldn't care about the anonymous animation expert fans on the internet lol.
Edit: I feel like I need to add that I dnt look into what studio is animating stuff. Summer time rendering had absolutely gorgeous animation and I didn't even kno OLM did It until today when I googled it. So I dnt really care for mappa or any other studio.

[â€“] Lgbr167 7 points 8 points 9 points 11 hours ago (0 children)
Dude this episode had one of the most stacked animator lists ever, we literally know for a fact that it could have been better if they had more time.
These animators got to where they are by holding themselves to a high standard, thatâ€™s why the studio can give them unreasonable timeframes knowing theyâ€™ll destroy their bodies in order to meet them.

Yet still they are producing top quality episodesðŸ��

[â€“] LastNap 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 hour ago (2 children)
Wait this episode was unfinished? I didnâ€™t even notice there was anything missing

[â€“] LePersianPrince 0 points 1 point 2 points 1 hour ago (1 child)
It was obviously missing a lot of post-production. It literally looked fan animated in some parts, other parts looked like production teaser quality rather than a finished product. It's obvious to me at least that they barely finished animation and coloring and didn't have time for any corrections, CG, lighting, detailing, etc.

[â€“] LastNap 0 points 1 point 2 points 57 minutes ago (0 children)
That makes sense, I read so I really just watch to see the fights animated and stuff so I didnâ€™t even pick up on that. Sucks they treat their employees like shit when they clearly make enough to pay and treat them well
