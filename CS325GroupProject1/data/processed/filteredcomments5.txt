I'm still scared to even start watching this arc because I know what will happen to my beloved comfort character Nanami Kento

I feel you, weirdly enough several of the most recent episodes have left me with actual chills. I was practically shaking by the end of this episode. I have never had that happen. Iâ€™m not exaggerating either, as much as I loved season 1 of jjk I have to be honest that during season 2 is the first time I started shaking from the hype.
I also have read the manga, so I knew what would happen but still got crazy chills watching it unfold in the anime. Itâ€™s been a fantastic experience so far.

Sukuna's rampage should be the least of your concerns.

I felt teary watching Yuji cry. I felt like reaching through the screen to hug him. They did a fantastic job with that scene!

[â€“] alethra_oberhelm 1 point 2 points 3 points 5 hours ago (0 children)
I usually don't cry over tv series or movies, but seeing Yuji's despair + the Specialz ost playing as though to mock him some more just shattered me and left me in shambles.
If I could reach out towards my TV and hug Yuji I would do it ðŸ¥º

Shibuya left me in tearsðŸ��

I respectfully disagree with using the opening song during Yuji's breakdown. It's like dance music.. and I don't really listen to the lyrics for symbolism since I'm trying to listen to the VA have a mental breakdown during an impactful moment.
But that's like my opinion

Fking Gojo's overconfidence led to all this shit. He should've just blitzed every cursed spirit without wasting time

[â€“] Legitimate_Cow7198 1 point 2 points 3 points 9 hours ago (7 children)
It wasn't his overconfidence it was his morals and obligations. He didn't want to kill the humans present, they explained how even a little fast movement from him would be like getting hit by a semi truck for a regular human. If Gojo gave no fucks, he would just kill everyone there with UV and call it a day.

[â€“] Adm_Kunkka 1 point 2 points 3 points 8 hours ago (6 children)
Hmm ok. Then I blame whoever let a finger be placed at a fking school and then sent a kid to retrieve it

[â€“] Legitimate_Cow7198 0 points 1 point 2 points 8 hours ago (5 children)
You act like a finger would not make its way down Yuji's throat eventually. You should blame the person who convinced Gojo to not let Yuji be killed.

[â€“] Adm_Kunkka 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (1 child)
I don't think Gojo would've let Yuji die even without Megumi. And why would a finger go down Yuji eventually? Noone knew he was a suitable vessel before right?

[â€“] Legitimate_Cow7198 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (0 children)
Well it's definitely likely Gojo would try and save him either way, but at the same time he asked Megumi what he wants him to do with Yuji, giving him the choice.

[â€“] Adm_Kunkka 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (2 children)
On that note, couldn't the trance granny used a finger to revive sukuna and basically own him? Could've tried that to fight Gojo

[â€“] Legitimate_Cow7198 0 points 1 point 2 points 6 hours ago (0 children)
Possibly, but maybe Sukuna technically not actually being dead might stop the technique from working on him.

[â€“] madgodcthulhu 0 points 1 point 2 points 3 hours ago (0 children)
I donâ€™t think so mahito touching sukunas soul almost got him instakilled and granny doesnâ€™t have near the power to get anywhere near that especially seeing as sukuna technically bound his soul to parts of his physical body so I donâ€™t think she could do anything but get her self killed

Have you seen hxh? They also use outro music a lil early. I'm under the impression they got their inspiration from them.
