Almost everyone's face look life-like except Akainu's. Alas.

Happy I am not the only one thinking his face looks weird.

[â€“] PhanThief95 2 points 3 points 4 points 21 hours ago (0 children)
Youâ€™d think itâ€™d be easy since Akainu is modeled after a real life Japanese actor like the rest of the Admirals.

Greenbull is like the least intimidating admiral.

Heâ€™s the definition of â€œtrying too hardâ€�

[+] Chihuathan 7 points 8 points 9 points 20 hours ago (0 children)
Which makes a lot of sense, considering the actor who inspired his design usually played bootlicking and violent psychopaths. Kinda fits that the one who can summon thorns is himself a massive prick.

Aramaki is the least threatening because the community just decided to use his actual translated code name unlike the non translated version like they do with every other admiral

[â€“] HiggsUAP The Revolutionary Army 1 point 2 points 3 points 5 hours ago (0 children)
Or because in his first showing he was scared off to promote a movie

I am joking man ... I don't know how much they cost but with the expensive prices lately even for most simple type of figurine in general, I wouldn't find it strange if these were their actual prices.
I have figurines of marvel characters in the early 2000 , that now make above 100+ $

I get why they did it, but I didnâ€™t really like the introduction for greenbull. I know they were part of the beast pirates and scummy but did queen and king really have to get fucked over like that? I donâ€™t even like his character honestly heâ€™s just bland
