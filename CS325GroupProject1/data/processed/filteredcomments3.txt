Reminds me of this game I used to play as a child where we held each other's chin and the first one to laugh got slapped

No it doesnâ€™t

These types of tats where you need to position them to "complete" the tat, are always stupid asf in real life.  And it looks like the dude doesn't have many more so that just makes it look worse.

[â€“] greenvented 5 points 6 points 7 points 16 hours ago (4 children)
why cant you just appreciate the tat instead of looking for negatives

[â€“] BossButterBoobs 0 points 1 point 2 points 16 hours ago (3 children)
Not like I had to look hard lol
Also don't have to appreciate anything if I don't like it.

[â€“] greenvented 0 points 1 point 2 points 16 hours ago (2 children)
fair enough but the art is nice you cant deny that

[â€“] BossButterBoobs 0 points 1 point 2 points 16 hours ago (0 children)
Yeah, the art is nice, I just think the tat is poorly conceived. It's a gimmick tattoo. Also, lines look kind of thin tbh

[â€“] dusttailed86 0 points 1 point 2 points 13 hours ago (0 children)
True, but in two years those super crisp lines will blur our to dark grey, and not only will it look blurred, the guy will be over putting his arms together to show people it. Guy has a valid point.

The possible theories make me believe this tatoo will age like wine
