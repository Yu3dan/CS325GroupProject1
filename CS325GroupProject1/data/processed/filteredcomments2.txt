If I were MAPPA's executives, I'll listen to Gojo fr. W take from Kaiji, too.

Not sure how many people actually partake in the English dub, but Kaijiâ€™s performance is absolutely phenomenal throughout. Really really impressed by his talent, and now his character and passion for the franchise/industry, after this tweet

[â€“] BirdCollections 27 points 28 points 29 points 13 hours ago (0 children)
He's really a standout performer!
You can ten he really cares about Gojo as a character too

I just watched the dub episodes and was thinking the same thing he is so awesome.

Yeah this definitely adds power to people calling mappa out for their outrageous practices.
Imagine mapping being petty as hell and just firing him though I'll actually awake my CT and fight the ceo of it

Even the VAâ€™s acknowledge them. MAPPA give them a break or a raise ðŸ��

well ideally both lol

So heartwarming to see Kaijiâ€™s support for the team - just a shame it had to come to this in the first place

Kaiji is an outstanding VA and he's so passionate about bringing Gojo to life. He keeps coming in with the hit tweets.

Kaiji is a gem and I'm glad he's willing to openly speak out about stuff like this. I know he was one of the VAs willing to put his neck on the line and condemn Crunchyroll for their poor pay over the JJK0 dub so stuff like this shows he's a legitimate upstanding fellow.

Kaiji Tang has probably become my favourite English VA. Gojo, Ichiban, even his role as Guts wasn't even that bad. This just solidifies his placement in the goat tier ðŸ��

They need a hiatus until next year. Then air the rest of the episodes.

Calling these episodes masterpieces will just make things worse
Why would Mappa change anything when they can just rush episodes and people will still like them.

The way someone put it in another thread is that itÂ´s better to praise the team while on the same breath denouncing what Mappa is doing or criticize specifically Mappa s CEO and the production team for it when pointing out the flaws so that the team doesnÂ´t think they re the ones being blamed.
We know these people have constantly delivered thought an awful schedule since 0, so it needs to be spelled out who s getting the praise and who s getting the middle finger for how things are turning out.

Man I love this guy. One of my favorite dub actors.

I am so mad towards people in Reddit that DARE complain about some parts that were not perfect in this episode. The animator had ONE week to this but they these people dare complain while wishfully forgetting all the great scenes they did right in the episode.

Kaiji Tang the GOAT. Heâ€™s my favourite English VA! Iâ€™m glad heâ€™s using his platform for this

Rest is very important and these people deserve it :3

A masterpiece ?! damn that episode looked fanmade at best

[â€“] DependentFearless162 2 points 3 points 4 points 6 hours ago (0 children)
I know you're downvoted but that episode was only 30% of what actual final cut.
