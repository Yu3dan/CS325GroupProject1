Reading Moria went to Blackbeard to find Absalom really throw me off for the first time because before i'd thought of him as just someone that only cares about himself, it really puts a whole new perspective on his whole reasoning to make zombies and also why Perona is so devoted to him
I really like his writing now

[â€“] Shiplord13 83 points 84 points 85 points 9 days ago (3 children)
The reality is that Moriah cares too much for those around him and when Kaido slaughter his whole crew it broke him. He reasoned that having a crew of corpses he wouldnâ€™t have to care about would easier and thus made a crew with mostly corpses that in theory would never â€œdieâ€� and very few living members. He did all to avoid being hurt again by having to watch his crew die. The moment Blackbeard killed Absalom was the moment it became clear Moriah would never work for him.

[â€“] Shiplord13 2 points 3 points 4 points 8 days ago (0 children)
He should be still alive. Like last time we saw him was after Thriller Bark with him on the raft with Moriah and Absalom. Also its implied the reason Moriah survived his encounter with Donflamingo who thought he died to his wounds was probably due to Hogback. So he is probably around just not actively fighting since he isn't a fighter and keeps his distance whenever Moriah gets into a dangerous situation.

[â€“] Quibbrel Void Month Survivor 454 points 455 points 456 points 9 days ago (22 children)
Listen as far as most pirates go and especially doing his job as a Warlord, Moria is a decent enough dude. He is no Saint, but could be far worse.
Not to mention seeking revenge for his crew, he does seem to have a level of care for the few people he does have around him. He went to fuck with Blackbeard after Absalom got captured and there's gotta be some love there to put up with Perona's personality.
And as a Warlord I adamantly think he literally did nothing wrong. He parked his ass right before the New World and took the shadows of so many pirates and did his job of hunting down pirates for the World Government. He didn't try to oppress or rule a kingdom like Crocodile and Dogflamingo. Blatantly help out the Straw Hats like Hancock, Mihawk, and Kuma. Or JOIN them like Jinbe. Dude is lazy but he worked smarter not harder.
Not to mention he actually showed up to Marineford with more or less no fight. When they had to drag Hancock kicking and screaming there or lock Jinbe's ass up for not wanting to.

[â€“] SuperiorLaw 216 points 217 points 218 points 9 days ago (6 children)
Should also be noted, Perona thought of him like a father cause he practically raised her. Just from her room and servants, it's obvious he considers her like a daughter he wants to dote on (giving her teddybear/animal minions, which would be harder to make than zombie minions)

My dad (real) called her after that and kind of mediated.

I like to think he did track her down, found her, had a semi-awkward meeting with Mihawk and then gave the pair his blessings. Mihawkâ€™s stoic faÃ§ade broke when he realized Moria thought he and Perona were a thing.

This is why the one thing I want to know before the manga ends is why the Gorosei wanted him specifically killed in battle. Yes he lost to Luffy but even then it doesn't seem like it would warrant his death otherwise they'd order everyone else who failed to death, Doflamingo said it was far above order and it makes me thing they wanted Moria's fruit to do something.

[â€“] Arkayjiya 17 points 18 points 19 points 9 days ago (5 children)
The fact that he lost to Luffy is a problem but not a major one as long as Luffy doesn't brag about it.
The fact that he got cleaned up like a scrub by Jimbei in one hit in front of camera however is the issue. The two warlords who peaced out, Croc and Jimbei, cruised through the war relatively unscathed while Moria, a current warlord, got his ass kicked on camera. That's not a good look for the warlord system.
At this point, I don't see any reason for the higher ups to lie to Doffy, they wouldn't even have needed to give him a reason at all if they didn't want to unless Moria somehow has some incredible secret no one, not even the readers know, on the level of Joyboy stuff which is... unlikely. So I'm tempted to think it's the truth.

[â€“] Porcphete 7 points 8 points 9 points 9 days ago (4 children)

[â€“] Arkayjiya 5 points 6 points 7 points 9 days ago (0 children)

[â€“] darewin 5 points 6 points 7 points 9 days ago (0 children)
That's irrelevant since WG kept the fight a secret. So to the viewing public, Moria was simply overpowered by Jimbei, ruining the reputation of the Warlords.

[â€“] CheesecakeExotic2056 4 points 5 points 6 points 9 days ago (1 child)
Moria had a lot of time to recover (eat and rest properly) between the battle with Luffy and the war.
JinBei, on the other hand, was locked in Impel down for quite awhile, then fought his way to escape impel down and reach the war. He didn't get any proper food or rest for many days, other than the brief moment they were travelling to marineford.

[â€“] TheMemetasticDonny 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
But Moria's power comes from his minions not himself, he lost a lot of good corpses against luffy that could have been used in the Marineford fight, his own personal strength is sh*t after all.

[+] Solid_Snark comment score below threshold -7 points -6 points -5 points 9 days ago (4 children)
I mean, yeah, as a Marine allyâ€¦
But the main theme of One Piece is Nakama. Loyalty and respect among friends. Transcending friendship into family.
And Moria desecrated thousands of Nakama for his own goals (and that of the Marines).
He might be the single worst OP character under those terms.

[â€“] RandAlSnore 42 points 43 points 44 points 9 days ago (2 children)
Heâ€™s extremely loyal to his own nakama though, arguably as much as Luffy is. He went into a Yonko territory to take back his crew mate, exactly what Luffy did. His own crewmate also came to save him.

[â€“] Solid_Snark 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (1 child)
Yeah, but when Luffy beats someone heâ€™s still respectful to them (like covering Katakuriâ€™s mouth).
He doesnâ€™t use their corpses as tools, or use their corpses against their own crew mates.
Thereâ€™s a big difference between respecting your own crew and still holding respect against your opponentsâ€™ crew.

Moria is basically telling us what will happen in the next arc and the resolution of the arc is the same. Luffy, aided by the shadows of all the people Moria stole from, barely defeats Moria, collapsing in defeat. Kuma shows up to find a decimated strawhat crew, and only decides that they are worth letting go when Zoro steps up to take on Luffy's pain. Kuma, knowing that they are not strong enough but seeing the potential in Luffy to inspire someone to such a degree, allows them to pass undisturbed. They as they are about to get wiped out by Kizaru, he shows up again to scatter them across the world. Luffy experiences the loss of his crew but their devotion to him brings them back together, stronger and smarter.

Moria was considered Kaidouâ€™s rival back then in the past, but Kaidou and his crew completely annihilated Moriaâ€™s crew. Moria came to the sad â€žconclusionâ€œ that he lost his highly valued crewmates because they could die, so he went the zombie army route since they canâ€™t die and can be resurrected with new shadows.
Moria is basically â€žbad end Luffyâ€œ and he predicted that Luffy would suffer a similar fate as him.

Kuma, Jinbe, Mihawk, and Boa definitely not. They are allies and working towards their own goals for the most part.
Doflamingo is too different from Luffy.
Crocodile at least until he started to rebuild again was kind of like that. There's a lot of parallels between him and Luffy in the Arabasta arc. I remember Luffy being disgusted at his idea of being hidden and scheming his way to power and the One Piece. Crocodile pre story went to the New World lost to Whitebeard and then changed his approach to using his intelligence and manipulation rather than brute force. Though even if Luffy broke down he would not be capable of that as he lacks those qualities.

Lethal? That word doesn't exist in Oda's vocabulary.

[â€“] le_trans_alt 33 points 34 points 35 points 9 days ago (10 children)
Lava is basically the one thing thatâ€™s consistently as lethal as it should be (ignoring that you shouldnâ€™t be able to survive being near it) regardless of your power level. From Kuma to Whitebeard, from Marineford to post-Wano, if Akainu chucks some at your face, half your face is melting off, no questions asked.
The only one I could even start to consider having resilience to lava beyond that of a real-life person is Sanji, and that guy is basically made of asbestos with his heatproofing and Germa exoskeleton.

[â€“] Not_an_okama 22 points 23 points 24 points 9 days ago (3 children)
Honestly, kaido and big mom are the only 2 others Iâ€™d question their death in a lava bath. Kaido especially. Dragons are just generally depicted as having insane heat resistance across media. As for big mom, she always has some kind of shenanigans. If there hadnâ€™t also been an eruption, Iâ€™d be convinced theyâ€™re gone, but with the eruption I think thereâ€™s room for them to have survived long enough to be ejected.

Big Mom could use her fruit to bring fire to life, what if she uses it to bring lava to life? I don't mind if she's dead for good, I just think Oda gave us too many "life flags" for Big Mom. There's a lot of things where if Big Mom is shown to be alive, there's enough for us to say the hints were in front of us all along.

[â€“] le_trans_alt 5 points 6 points 7 points 9 days ago (0 children)
yeah logically Big Mom is definitely dead even taking the whole â€œnever saw the bodyâ€� thing into account, but narratively she definitely found a way to wriggle out of that jam.

Lava is basically the one thing thatâ€™s consistently as lethal as it should be (ignoring that you shouldnâ€™t be able to survive being near it)
Except that lava being consistently lethal is absolute dogshit. Kaido's Blast Breath is far hotter than lava judging by how much matter it can melt and evaporate at once, and characters can survive that. Lava should be a non-issue to any top tier realistically
The only one I could even start to consider having resilience to lava beyond that of a real-life person is Sanji, and that guy is basically made of asbestos with his heatproofing and Germa exoskeleton.
What? Sanji is durable, sure, but he does not seem to have anywhere near the durability of an actual Lunarian, and I doubt that BM and Kaido are too far behind him in this category

[â€“] le_trans_alt 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (2 children)
itâ€™s honestly interesting that so far, Blast Breath and bombs and deadly poison and every fucking thing obeys the charactersâ€™ power scaling in terms of â€œyou can shake off things you shouldnâ€™t be able to surviveâ€� (unless the plot wills otherwise) but when itâ€™s specifically magma, everyone is a mundane human with no defensive feats of that scale. hypertech cyborg? half your face is gone. worldâ€™s strongest man capable of taking cannon fire to the face without serious injury? half your face is gone. top-tier commander of the worldâ€™s strongest man and youâ€™re made of fire? donut time and instant game over. lava should theoretically be a non-issue to any top tier but in practice itâ€™s vaporize-on-contact juice to everyone.
And yeah when I said that Sanji could maybe survive it that was indeed a stretch, and I straight up completely forgot about King and the Lunarians.

Bro Lava is lethal.
It melted off half of Whitebeard's head in one hit. Same for the sturdy cyborg Kuma.

I didn't want to say old age because Oda suggested that one piece is a world where old age doesn't have to be a limiting factor in strength with how strong characters like Rayleigh, Garp and Big Mom are despite being retirement age. WB was probably the oldest of the "old" fighters.

People always forget Moria had an incredibly strong crew compared to the other Shichibukai since Oars defeated all the General Zombies. The WG disposed of Moria because his strength was in his zombie army which he lost after being driven out of Thriller Bark.

[â€“] l3reezer 3 points 4 points 5 points 9 days ago * (2 children)
The time-skip power creep kinda complicates that.
Can zombies use haki? Can any of Moria's crew? Boa has at least 2 who can use the main types of haki and a whole country of women trained from birth to be warriors who can use haki arrows she can pick from to recruit into her crew.
Doflamingo also has a crew of 10+ Devil Fruit users, at least 2 people who can use fullbody haki (Vergo honestly might be able to solo Moria's entire crew as they were depicted pre-time-skip), Sugar with arguably the most OP fruit ever (but I guess Perona gives her a run for her money), and Monet whose snow powers could arguably incapacitate Moria's entire zombie army.
Sun Pirates are pretty strong too and Fish-man Karate is probably advantageous to defeating zombies. Even beyond strength, Wadatsumi is just pure bigger than Oars (though Wadatsumi wasn't apart of the Sun Pirates until post-time-skip), and Oars was kind of just known for his strength deriving from his size not any actual skill. Wadatsumi's got pretty good hands, based on his boxing match with the Kraken/Surume.

I mean his plan was to use Luffy's shadow to beat stronger and stronger pirates until  he had an army of monsters. Assuming he got that far he could have put up a  decent fight but he'd be waiting a bit for the strong ones to obey him. He doesn't have to outright beat their ass to take their shadows, just catch them offguard.

Waiting for the Moria glow up, his fruit is absolutely broken. He will either end up allied to Luffy as a fleet member or might be a dark horse sh contender.
I know lots of people have moria joining the cross guild, but he has more reasons to join Luffy then the CG. Luffy beat Kaido AND Luffy will have motivation to fight Blackbeard, so to avenge Absalom Moria has incentive to join him but has no reason to join CG expecting them to be willing to do the same.

Moria hardly seems like the sort of person to submit, least of all to the man who trashed his home, released all his souls and ruined his best zombies. I could see him aligning with the SHs as a somewhat distant but otherwise friendly party who ends up joining the fray in the big battle

Momo & the Retainers prolly hate him more

i need him to link up with luffy asap

2/3 points are headcanon that hasnâ€™t been confirmed (only confirmed rocks pirate is John and ancient giant kaido stuff is entirely a theory)

[â€“] Pomoa 9 points 10 points 11 points 9 days ago (4 children)
2 points are confirmed then, Ryuma and Captain John.

[â€“] Azure_Triedge 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (3 children)
OP said members, heâ€™s talking about the theory going around right now connecting similar designs with rocks pirates and general zombies, which isnâ€™t confirmed. If OP was just talking about john he wouldâ€™ve said that.

[â€“] Pomoa 8 points 9 points 10 points 9 days ago (1 child)
Just saw the post you're referring too and... I don't know about the claw guy, but the armored dude is pretty convincing to me.
I mean, what are the odds of Oda drawing drawing Captain John along two completely unrelated dude that wear the same helmet, with a pretty similar face, 16 years apart.
And that dude was drawn as if we should know who it is, in the last chapter...

[â€“] Azure_Triedge 2 points 3 points 4 points 9 days ago (0 children)
i wonâ€™t be suprised if itâ€™s revealed that itâ€™s true, and i think it would be cool if so.
Itâ€™s just posts like these that spout head canon and theory like fact are all over this sub and it gets tiring. Especially when peopleâ€™s headcanons are revealed to be false and they get mad

[â€“] Pomoa 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
Well, I'll give him half a point then. Moriarty did put some effort toward getting the corpse of at least one of the Rocks

[â€“] MinusMentality 1 point 2 points 3 points 9 days ago (0 children)
I kinda want Moria to return with Zombie Kaido and Big Mom. Maybe have Zombie Big Mom defect due to Soul Fruit hax.. and then she goes after Luffy even stronger than before.

Wow, One Piece community more readers like these, people can look into things not just glance on them.

[â€“] fameboygame 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
Ok I hate to admit thriller bark wasnâ€™t my favourite (Luffy pushing down that zombie will be my favourite tho!) but I did not know that he specifically made it for Kaido.
Time to read it again!

[â€“] vren10000 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
Moria went all in on his grudge and forgot to use his level up points on his stats, unfortunately. Having said that, his Haki should have been insane in Thriller Bark, given his determination to kill Kaido.

[â€“] Livid_Ad9749 -1 points 0 points 1 point 9 days ago (0 children)
I hate Kaido. Way too much time spent on his boring arc

[â€“] PASTOR_DALE_DOYAG -1 points 0 points 1 point 9 days ago (0 children)
Kaido violated moria so bad he went back to the first half of the grand line and became probably eat a 4 boxes of Krispy Kreme a day cause dude really let go of himself

[â€“] greegon -2 points -1 points 0 points 9 days ago (0 children)
Not to mention that Perona and absalom's dfs are perfect for torturing Kaido, both with negative hollow and and dishonorable invisibility based combat.

Who said he did it specifically for kaido. Yeah the corpse choices fit what you say, but they also fit that he just wanted strong corpses.

[â€“] mokush7414 22 points 23 points 24 points 9 days ago (6 children)
Who said he did it specifically for kaido.
There's no way it's a coincidence he loses to Kaido, then steals corpses of people associated with either Kaido or killing dragons.

[â€“] le_trans_alt 1 point 2 points 3 points 9 days ago (5 children)
Iâ€™d believe it being a coincidence, but Moria sure as hell isnâ€™t gonna complain about it.

[â€“] mokush7414 7 points 8 points 9 points 9 days ago (4 children)
One or two sure. But all of these? Thereâ€™s no way.

[â€“] zroach 3 points 4 points 5 points 9 days ago (3 children)
Especially since getting Ryuma and Susui out of Wano would be a bitch of a task to pull off.

[â€“] DarkAztaroth 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (2 children)
Odds are they probably got Oars from Wano too, given the whole Onigashima / ogre business

[â€“] zroach 4 points 5 points 6 points 9 days ago (1 child)
He got Oars from "The Land of Ice" wherever that is.

Ohh didn't remember that being a thing, had assumed they just got em in Ringo

Whatâ€™s with the Moria agenda in this sub lately? I  swear I see a post about it every other day now

[â€“] gojo_blindfolded 6 points 7 points 8 points 9 days ago (0 children)
It's due to the latest chapter. Thriller bark is (theorized) being compared to a certain island.

[â€“] br4d1cal 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
It would actually be really interesting to see a serious fight between Moria with ALL of his zombies (including the ones with the Strawhats' shadows) vs Kaido. Kaido probably wins, but Oars, Moria and the General Zombies could put up a great fight. If we include Perona making him hate himself and Absalom with his vanishing act, it might be a challenge.

And now that kaido is gone he canâ€™t even get proper revenge poor dude lmao

[â€“] Nicobade 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
I really wish we got a small Kaido flashback, 5 chapters or under, in Wano that could've shown us their relationship. Maybe they had a history together before Kaido killed Moria's crew, plus it could've confirmed whether Kaido is actually a separate race and descended from ancient giants, which is still just a theory.

It's no accident that one of Moria's top commanders had the strength of a beast and was animalistic in nature.

Could you imagine if Kaido died at God valley and his corpse was used

[â€“] Mekbop 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
Hopefully Kaido is really dead and Mora animates his corpse.

[â€“] 100evo 0 points 1 point 2 points 9 days ago (0 children)
And this Moria got beaten by the rookie Luffy. Moria knew exactly he would never be on same tier with Kaido that he just went on with his illusionary dream of defeating Kaido while being lazy.

[â€“] MyDayIsRuined6143 0 points 1 point 2 points 8 days ago (0 children)
Its' fun to think that Moria would train and be buff again in his 2 year captivity by BB in Fullalead Island.
Strong enough to match Kaido.
