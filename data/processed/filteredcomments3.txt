Almost everyone's face look life-like except Akainu's. Alas.

Happy I am not the only one thinking his face looks weird.

Youâ€™d think itâ€™d be easy since Akainu is modeled after a real life Japanese actor like the rest of the Admirals.

Heâ€™s the definition of â€œtrying too hardâ€�

Which makes a lot of sense, considering the actor who inspired his design usually played bootlicking and violent psychopaths. Kinda fits that the one who can summon thorns is himself a massive prick.

I am joking man ... I don't know how much they cost but with the expensive prices lately even for most simple type of figurine in general, I wouldn't find it strange if these were their actual prices.
I have figurines of marvel characters in the early 2000 , that now make above 100+ $

God I hate greenbull but I love his pants design and coordinated shoes.

I get why they did it, but I didnâ€™t really like the introduction for greenbull. I know they were part of the beast pirates and scummy but did queen and king really have to get fucked over like that? I donâ€™t even like his character honestly heâ€™s just bland
